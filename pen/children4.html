        little jay made a triumphant declaration upon finally finding himself
        face to face with uncle dave.&nbsp; in accordance with
        leprechaun-uncle/teacher lore, the capture of such a creature entitled
        his captor to all wrongly deducted points from up to three homework
        assignments, which was the sole purpose of little jay's quest after
        uncle dave.&nbsp; the evil grader-gnomes very much enjoyed the act of
        point theft and thus committed it every time the opportunity presented
        itself.&nbsp; instances had been reported wherein these evil
        grader-gnomes had stolen five points from a problem which had only four
        points possible.&nbsp; these evil grader-gnomes were quite clever,
        however, and knew full well that if any given assignment came back with
        a negative score it would have very little chance of remaining
        uncomplained-about.

        unfortunately, all this blather about the evil tendencies of the evil
        grader-gnomes gave uncle dave his much desired chance to escape.&nbsp;
        he desired this opportunity so greatly because (as any being should be
        aware of) leprechaun-uncle/teachers have a reputation to keep up for
        being amazingly skilled at eluding capture.&nbsp; the only notion of
        uncle dave that little jay could observe at this point was a hideously
        evil chortle which resonated menacingly throughout the building.&nbsp;
        this most recent disappointment pushed little jay over the edge and
        caused him to seek stolen-point justice by some manner other than
        regaining the points.&nbsp; and so he journeyed downward to the dank
        depths wherein dwelled the evil grader-gnomes.&nbsp; he noticed that the
        evil grader-gnome domain had a very low level of luminance, which
        apparently introduced no inconvenience since evil grader-gnomes are
        almost completely blind.&nbsp; little jay wasted no time in herding all
        the evil grader-gnomes he could fit into the elevator and then taking
        them up to the top.&nbsp; he then proceeded to dump the evil
        grader-gnomes out the window and kept plunging the elevator back for
        more until the evil grader-gnomes were no more.&nbsp; at this point
        there was (of course) much rejoicing and the need to capture uncle dave
        fell away.
