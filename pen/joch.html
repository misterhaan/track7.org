        "There is corruption in our midst," said the Jay. Everyone's faces
        displayed expressions suggesting surprise and awe, but the Jay knew
        who had done the wrong. As leader of the InterStory Alliance Against
        Evil Story-Hoppers (ISAAESH), he was to decide their fate. "You know
        who you are, and I know you know who you are, so stand up in shame
        for all to see."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The Curt, former leader of the ISAAESH, along with the Steve, knew
        they had been found out and thus stood. The Jay then began to
        explain to the other members of the ISAAESH what wrong the two
        wrongdoers had done wrong. He then turned to speak to them. "You
        have both gone and done bad awful nasty things in another story. You
        interfered in a way which severely affected the outcome of that
        story, in violation of the Prime Directive."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That's a Star Trek copyright," the Jay's lawyer whispered to him.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Never mind that last part." The Jay then went on to explain how
        they had pulled a character named Captain Curt out of his story to
        prevent him from falling into a pit. They held him until the danger
        had passed, when they returned him. This violated the rule against
        unnecessary interference in other stories. The Jay's lawyer smiled
        at the new wording.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The Jay called the committee of important stuff to meet and decide
        what to do about it. They found out that the Curt and the Steve had
        also done something else in the story while they were there. Since
        fixing this was more important than deciding the punishment, they
        sent the Jay to fix it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Jay pressed some buttons on his calculator-looking thing and looked
        at the display. He watched and read the subtitles as one of the
        characters said something about the ship being separated before and
        now it was back together. Jay realized that he had arrived just in
        time. He jumped up and dove at the ground. The paper ripped and he
        fell through and landed on the floor in the other story. He greeted
        them and introduced himself as Wayfarer Jay. Then he told them how
        their ship had been put together. They seemed close enough to
        understanding, so he pressed the buttons on his shoes. His shoes
        rocketed him back up through the rip and he scotch-taped it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        After a completely unknown amount of time, the Jay returned to the
        ISAAESH headquarters. The Curt and the Steve were sentenced to spend
        the rest of the story in the Eternal Story of the Never-ending
        Bummer. Then they would have to serve community service for the
        duration of the next sequel. They grumbled as Arnie the Big Guy led
        them away, but they didn't fight it. They knew that they had done
        wrong. Well, either that or it was because Arnie the Big Guy was
        quite enormous.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        The Jay went back to his house with the Puddy. They were both eager
        to see his new program that he had written the day before. The Jay
        walked over to his computer and ran the program. The lights dimmed
        due to the massive power drain, even though they weren't on.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Did it work?" asked Allene.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I don 't know, Allene," Jay got out his CLT and pressed some
        buttons. He showed it to Allene. "And it's not a 'calculator looking
        thing' anymore, it 's a 'CLT.'"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What 's that," asked Allene, "celery, lettuce, and tomato?" Jay just
        ignored it because he knew it was merely a pathetic attempt at a
        joke. She probably hadn't even realized that celery, lettuce, and
        tomatoes are all vegetables and wouldn't make much of a sandwich.
        Some people would argue that tomatoes are fruit and not vegetables,
        but let's just say those people have too much time to waste on
        worrying about that kind of stuff.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay," said Jay and Allene, "those people have too much time to
        waste on worrying about that kind of stuff."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hey!" Sir Jay protested, "That joke belongs to my story!" Jay
        wondered who this guy was (though he looked familiar) and why he was
        in this story. "Well, I should get back to my story. Even though I'm
        from a story that hasn't been written yet, there's probably
        something I need to be there for." And with that, he was gone.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The author, at this point, became bored and fell asleep because he
        was in math class. Jay saw that he could now do whatever he wanted
        without the author bugging him about it. He ran to the cupboard and
        saw that it was bare. Then he ran to find Mrs. Hubbard. She kept
        taking all of Jay's stuff from his cupboard because she wanted a
        bone for her dog. She just wouldn't understand that he didn't even
        keep his bones in the cupboard. He kept them in the refrigerator as
        anyone else with any sense would. Mrs. Hubbard was nice about giving
        the contents of Jay's cupboard back, so he took them home and put
        them away and was suddenly overcome by an urge to open the
        refrigerator.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        He opened the door and noticed a small cartoon-looking super hero
        man who was running around and eating all of the dairy products. Jay
        grabbed a bone out of the door and hit the guy with it, causing him
        to fall to the floor. He then threw a piece of cheese that had a
        hole eaten out of it such that the hole fell over the little guy and
        pinned his arms to his sides, causing him to fall. The little man
        got up and said "refrigerator raider." He then began eating the
        cheese as he scurried away. Jay just shrugged and went to look for
        something to do.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        After a short while, Jay observed that he was walking through a
        forest. "Strange," he said, "I'm walking through a forest. I didn't
        know this story had a forest." Then, slightly to his surprise, a
        disgruntled little green elf with curly-toed shoes jumped down from
        somewhere. He had a candy cane that was extremely sharp on the end
        because he had been sucking on it without biting it off. Jay looked
        at the pointed tip in amazement because he could never suck without
        biting so his never got pointy. The little man took a step toward
        him and Jay realized that this menacing midget was threatening him
        with his sharpened sugar stick.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hey," complained Jay, "enough with the alliteration already, I'm
        getting tounge - twisted."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "You're weird," accused Taylor.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Shut up already you bunch of freaks," said the evil little man as
        he lunged at Jay with his candy stick. Jay fumbled in his pockets
        and realized that he didn't have his magical glowing stick or
        anything else that could save him. All he could find was his scotch
        tape dispenser.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The little man made his move and stabbed Jay right in the left arm.
        The end broke off in Jay's arm, so the little man had to put it in
        his mouth to resharpen it. Jay screamed in pain so loud that the
        author woke up. He scotch-taped his wound to keep it from bleeding.
        The nasty elf once again had a sharp point on his peppermint stick
        (he <i>really</i> sucked). He started for Jay once again, but part
        of the candy cane in Jay's arm had dissolved into his bloodstream,
        giving him an immense sugar high. As soon as the elf was close
        enough, Jay kicked him in the face, causing him to fall over
        unconscious.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Immediately after that, a not so disgruntled elf swung by on a vine
        and picked up the evil one that had attacked Jay. Then Jay noticed a
        large sign above a door that said "Home Sweet Home." He had no idea
        what this last part of the story with the forest and all was about,
        so he went through the door.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Just about then, Curt and Steve were being forced to listen to Mr.
        Linzmeyer's jokes over and over in the Eternal Story of the
        Never-ending Bummer. Curt couldn't take it anymore, so he took Steve
        and escaped. This made them fugitive characters, which they were
        fully aware of, but a price they were willing to pay for escape from
        Mr. Linzmeyer. They knew that now ISAAESH, which Curt had actually
        founded a few stories ago, would now be out after them and they
        would never be able to go home.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Jay was still on a buzzing from the candy cane, which was causing
        him to run in circles around a tree in his front yard. Allene walked
        up and waited for him to stop. Jay made a few more revolutions
        before he noticed her. "Hi!" he said between breaths. He ran up to
        her and began jumping up and down and attempting to click his heels
        together. "There's no place like--"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Can't you just hold still?" Allene interrupted. Jay stopped jumping
        up and down and began orbiting her. "Hey! I'm trying to deliver
        important news here..."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I'm listening..."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Well hold still so I know for sure." Jay kept orbiting her, which
        he must have found quite amusing because he began to giggle
        gleefully.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hey!" complained Jay as he came to a stop. "I though I told you to
        cap the alliteration." Allene told him of Curt and Steve's escape
        while the author made faces at Jay. "Hey, well that just isn't a
        good thing," said Jay, meaning that the author shouldn't stick his
        tounge out at him.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I know," said Allene, who had understandably assumed that Jay was
        talking about the escape, "and we haven't had an adventure for a
        while, so it seems to me that we should go after them." Jay stopped
        for a second to hold his chin and ponder the length of that last
        sentence.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        After deciding it had not surpassed the legal limit set by the
        bureau of waits and restrictions, Jay checked his script and saw
        that indeed they were supposed to pursue the fugitives as Allene had
        suggested.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        The author came back after a break of two month duration. By now the
        plot had thickened in a way paralleling what soup does when you
        forget to put away the leftovers. The story continued in this manner
        for a while, but still without author it began to become rather
        watered down, similar to what happens when you purchase a Pepsi from
        Taco Bell and leave it in the car so the ice cubes melt. The author
        found his story much as he had left it, with the obvious exception
        of all the stuff that had happened while he was gone. Allene and Jay
        had given up their quest and Steve and Curt were about to discover
        this.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Curt sat down and Steve did the same. "How peculiar," commented Curt
        after taking a sip of tea. "You would expect them to know where we
        are." His gaze then drifted to a man sitting alone in a booth.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The man appeared to be having trouble eating his salid with his
        spoon and knife. Curt was about to go attempt to aid the man, but a
        light shone down upon the man and a large, booming voice from above
        spoke, saying, "USE THE FORKS, LUKE." Curt then noticed the name
        patch on the man's shirt upon which was written Luke.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Steve had seen what happened. The bad jokes had seeped into this
        story. Steve and Curt had brought it with them and contaminated an
        otherwise perfectly fine story.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hey, that was kind of punny," said Curt. Steve smacked him politely
        and explained the serious horridness of the situation.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "No! You don't understand!" complained the now hysteric Steve. "This
        story has been infected--and it's all our fault! We have to get out
        of here before it gets worse!" He let go of Curt's shirt and stopped
        shaking him. The two decided that it was best to go home even though
        they were sure to be found there by those who had already sentenced
        them. They would most likely be punished with increased severity,
        but they didn't want their bad jokes to destroy any more stories.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "One last thing." Jay grabbed some candy canes from the shelf and
        put them in his pocket. He pulled the hidden handle in the wall and
        opened the secret door. He stepped through it into the tunnel and
        closed the door behind him. Just then, Paul entered the room because
        he thought he hadn't been in the story yet. He didn't see Jay, so he
        called to him. He waited for a while, and getting no reply, left.
        After he got out the door, he thought he saw two people duck behind
        a nearby building. He decided to go see who it was.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Is he coming?" asked Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I can't check--he'll see me if he is coming." Steve inched toward
        the corner and poised himself to attack whoever it was who had seen
        them. Much to Steve's unexpectedness, an arm with a hand on the end
        reached around the corner and grabbed him. The body that the other
        end of the arm was attached to stepped around the corner and Curt
        observed that this person had Paul under his other arm.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I don't suppose you two have your senior release cards either, do
        you?" demanded the big guy who had Steve under one arm and Paul
        under the other.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What?" said Steve.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Who are you?" asked Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I am Joch."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hey Steve, I guess the yolk's on you," joked Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That's Joch," corrected Joch, "Now show me your senior release
        cards or I shall have to give you all structured lunch." At this
        point, Curt was wondering why he got to be the one not under an arm,
        but none of them had a senior release card or even knew what a
        senior release card was. Joch took them away, Paul under one arm,
        Steve under the other, and Curt under the other. Now he did not
        actually have that many upper appendages, but Joch was not exactly a
        man of high intellect and most definitely did not even know what an
        upper appendage was.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        After an undetermined amount of time, Joch had them all sit down at
        a long table on the side of the cafeteria. He then allowed them to
        purchase some overpriced substances that was called food. When they
        got back to the table, Jay and Allene were there too. Jay was
        attempting to drink what was called a chocolate milk shake but
        actually more closely resembled ice cream. He surmised that it
        would probably work better with a spoon. He thought to himself that
        he had never surmised before, so it must've been important. He
        informed Joch of his surmision, who told Jay that giving the
        students spoons would have catastrophic implications, but being of
        not exactly high intellect, was unable to explain the reasoning to
        Jay, who was eventually successful in convincing Joch to get spoons
        for tomorrow. Joch took his cart and pushed it outside to patrol the
        parking lot.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        A voice from above called all their names after telling them they
        had to go somewhere. They found it strange that the voice from above
        chose not to call their names first and catch their attention so
        that they would listen to where they were supposed to go. After an
        ambiguous passing of time, they decided to wander out into the hall.
        Paul pointed out that some fool had left two rows of lockers right
        in the middle of the hall. Jay found it rather silly, but took a
        drink of his ice cream and kept walking.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        All of a sudden, a Sean Connery look-alike came out of nowhere and
        took everyone's "food." They had only seen him long enough to notice
        that he looked like Sean Connery before he disappeared between the
        lockers. A haunting laughter echoed through the hall.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        After everyone recovered from the shock of that last paragraph, Curt
        noticed a map. "Hey look," pointed Curt, "a map." Jay decided that
        they should look at the map because Curt was not allowed to make
        decisions since he and Steve were supposed to be in exile.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "How do they know where we are?" asked Paul, pointing at the "You
        are here" sticker. Jay pointed to the security camera on the ceiling
        in the corner and Paul nodded in understanding. Steve then found the
        "You should be here" sticker and they left.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        It is important to keep in mind at this point that most characters
        would have simply sat down and given up long before this point.
        Obviously, what's happening in the story right now at least seems to
        have absolutely nothing to do with the part of the story coming
        before it. This, of course, confuses most characters. Our
        characters, however, know that their author has problems and are
        quite accustomed to being confused by the situations he puts them
        in. This is why they do not stop to think about what's happening.
        Another fact to take note of is that the author repeatedly took
        lengthy breaks from writing this story and misplaced the original
        plot somewhere between here and South New West Maine. Since Maine is
        in the Northeast, the author found it futile to attempt to recover
        the original plot.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        In the time it took to discuss the last paragraph, our characters
        had reached the place called student services. A medium length beep
        sounded through the halls before they entered. Jay walked up to a
        nearby desk and told the secretary that they had been called there.
        "Well now you're all late," she scolded.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Go see your counselors and get your schedules."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Who's my counselor?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The secretary motioned toward a rather lengthy list on the wall and
        grumbled something about having to write passes now. They all went
        to the list except the secretary who continued to grumble. Paul was
        the only one who seemed to be able to find his name, so he found
        where his counselor was on the map next to the list. The rest of the
        group sat down while Paul went in.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What's your student identification number?" asked the counselor.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "My what?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Your ID number." The counselor saw that Paul still appeared
        confused, so he picked up a strange wand-like device, bent Paul's
        left ear forward, and scanned the barcode. "So, number 986263," he
        said after typing something on the computer, "what can I do for
        you?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "The secretary said to get my schedule." The counselor said okay,
        typed some more and handed Paul the printout of his schedule. Paul
        got up to leave and noticed that Jay had been watching him. The
        secretary told Paul that it was fourth hour and he had better hurry
        because the pass she was giving him was unexcused. Paul wandered
        aimlessly down the hall. Jay had taken the others and escaped
        through an air vent while the secretary was occupied.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Where are we?" asked Steve.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "We're in the ventilation system," replied Jay after reading the
        "ventilation system" sign next to him. They crawled a little further
        and Jay fell through a vent since that always seems to happen when
        people start crawling through ventilation systems. He noticed a wall
        of television monitors displaying various locations in the school
        and told the others to come down. He ended up at the bottom of the
        resulting pile of bodies, which he was understandably not especially
        thrilled about. They all got up and looked at the monitors.
        Suddenly, it was time for lunch and there was nothing they could do
        about it.

        In the lunch line, Jay noticed a container of spoons next to the
        straws, so he picked one up. "Spoon!" he yelled in joy. Mrs.
        Grunwald cried out in frustration because she couldn't find anything
        to mark wrong on the test she was correcting. Jay tossed her a spoon
        and she made up an error for the test and seemed to be satisfied.

        They all got their lunches (except Paul, since he had an accident
        with a computer in one of his classes and will make no further
        appearances in this story) and attempted to sit down at a nearby
        table. They would have had no trouble doing it, but Joch crawled out
        from underneath the table and brought them to a different table.

        Although this table was no different from any of the other tables,
        Jay was not content with sitting there. He held his spoon high in
        the air and once again yelled, "Spoon!" but this time in rebellion.
        The others at the table did the same thing and joined him in a spoon
        attack on Joch.

        Once they had "spooned" Joch, they found that they were able to sit
        wherever they pleased. The other teachers in the cafeteria either
        didn't notice or didn't care since it was merely Joch. Most of the
        other people at the table stayed at that table since they had never
        sat at a table other than that one and were scared. Our characters
        went to the table they had attempted to sit at originally. They ate
        their "food" and began eating their ice cream because with spoons
        they no longer had to attempt to drink it.

        After Curt had eaten most of his ice cream, he noticed that his
        spoon was not long enough to reach the rest of the ice cream in the
        bottom of his cup. Allene took it to the microwave for him and he
        was then able to drink it with a straw. Then Steve said that if he
        had two buns he'd eat them. When they were done eating, Jay realized
        that he had been doing something before, so he left. Allene went
        with him because she tended to do that. Everyone else began
        wandering the halls, having nothing to do. Steve noticed someone jog
        by and stab someone else with a plastic spoon. A teacher-type being
        said, "We have a run-by spooning in sector 7-D," into her
        walkie-talkie.

        "Wait a minute," said Curt, "where did this school come from?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What are you talking about?" asked Steve. Curt looked around and
        saw that there was no longer a school. "Hey, where's Jay and
        Allene?"

        "I don't know, let's just go home."
