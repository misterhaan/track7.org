        There once was an Ooo Ooy.&nbsp; It was big.&nbsp; It was a boy,
        like its friends, the Steve and The J.&nbsp; TheJ was a famous
        professional pencil fighter.&nbsp;  The Steve was dead, because the
        Paul killed him in a pencil fight (before he was banned from
        pencil-fighting for using a pen), so he was a ghost.&nbsp; The Paul
        would be a ghost, but it isn't possible (and it wasn't possible back
        then either) to kill a Paul.&nbsp; The Ooo Ooy was a good demon that
        the Steve met after he died.

        One day, the Steve was playing a game with the Ooo Ooy.&nbsp; The
        Steve was disappearing through walls, and the Ooo Ooy would run
        around and look for him.&nbsp; The Paul, who thought that the Ooo
        Ooy was cool because it was a demon, asked if he could play with
        them.&nbsp; The Steve said that the Paul couldn't play because he
        killed the Steve.&nbsp; The Paul got mad and left to go after The J,
        because The J beat the Paul in a pencil fight exactly one story ago
        and discovered that the Paul was cheating.

        The J was practicing a new hobby that he had just made up.&nbsp; It
        was called pencil-throwing.&nbsp; His pencil lead was long enough,
        so he took it out of the drafting sharpener.&nbsp; He brought it
        over to his desk and put a sharp point on it.&nbsp; It had to have a
        very sharp point to stick into whatever it was that The J decided to
        throw it into.&nbsp; The Paul rang the doorbell and The J turned
        around very quickly and his throwing pencil flew and hit the door.&nbsp;
        The J said to come in, so the Paul did.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I challenge you to a rematch pencil fight," said the Paul.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay," said The J, "but only if YOU get a judge to decide who wins."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        In about 3 minutes, 33.46 seconds, the Paul came back with a judge.&nbsp;
        "The Ooo Ooy will be our judge," said the Paul.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay," said The J, "let's start."&nbsp; The Paul charged at The J,
        but The J moved over and the Paul broke the only real pencil he
        owned on the wall.&nbsp; That made him even angrier, so he started
        slashing at The J.&nbsp; The Paul thought that The J knew that the
        broken end of the pencil would hurt him more than a single point, so
        he expected The J to be more careful.&nbsp; The J jumped forward and
        stabbed the Paul in his fighting wrist.&nbsp; The Paul let out a cry
        of pain that the whole world heard.&nbsp; An English teacher who was
        a good witch heard it, even though it was so far away.&nbsp;  The
        Paul was really mad now.&nbsp; He charged at The J again, but this
        time The J was hit by the end of the Paul's pencil.&nbsp; To the
        Paul's surprise, The J did not scream, but a circular cut appeared
        on his arm that he didn't use for pencil fighting.&nbsp; This made
        the Paul wonder how The J could stand to be stabbed with a jagged
        pencil-end and not scream.&nbsp; As the Paul was wondering about
        this, The J threw his pencil across the room and it went right next
        to the Paul's head before it hit the wall behind him and stuck in
        really far.&nbsp; The Paul once again was surprised, but this time
        he ignored it and lunged for The J again.&nbsp; He hit The J right
        in his heart, but The J wasn't even weakened.

      <p class="story">
        "So!" said The J, "The great pencil fighter Paul isn't as great as
        he thought."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "The J wins!" said the Ooo Ooy.
