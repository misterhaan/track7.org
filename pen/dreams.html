        Would you believe me if I told you that even the best of my dreams I
        actually prefer to wake up from?&nbsp; A little more than a year ago, I
        wouldn't have either.&nbsp; Not long ago, however, I realized this as
        truth.&nbsp; As much as my body complains to me that I should allow it
        more sleep, my mind has lost its ability to create in a dream a fantasy
        more desirable than that of my real life experience.&nbsp; It may appear
        from that explanation that I have lost the ability to dream up a decent
        fantasy, but on the contrary I tell you that the change is not in my
        dreams, it is in my life experience.

        I used to lie in my bed at the end of each day hoping for a few dreams by
        which I might escape the events of the day.&nbsp; Of course this desire
        has left me almost in entirety--all I wish to escape now is going to bed
        alone.&nbsp; This change has contributed to the decrease in sleep I
        get.&nbsp; I am fully aware as my body continually reminds me that I
        didn't even get enough sleep in my previous situation, and here I am now
        with even less.&nbsp; And I would sleep more--I get the good old, "why
        don't you just go to bed earlier," or, "don't get up so early on
        weekends," but it's not as easy as others expect it to be.&nbsp; And it
        has nothing to do with how much I have to do each day either--I instead
        believe that the reason I spend less time sleeping is (as I mentioned
        previously) that I prefer my reality to my dreams.&nbsp; In reality,
        there's Brit.&nbsp; In dreams there may or may not be, and even if there
        is, dreams are not real, but reality of course is.

        After that last statement you might try to convince me that a dream Brit
        should be better than a real Brit because in a dream I should be able to
        have anything I want.&nbsp; Of course this seems valid, but not only is
        it impossible to have reality in a dream, but the real Brit is actually
        many times better than anything I could ever dream.

        A few days ago I was with her and a song was playing about waking up from
        an exceptionally wonderful dream.&nbsp; Everything about my relationship
        with Brit seems too good to be true, so what if it actually IS a dream,
        and what would I do if I woke up?&nbsp; I cannot think of a time of
        greater joy than that instant as the tears rolled and I wondered to
        myself how many people get to live their lives a dream, all the while
        knowing that there can be no waking up, since after all the whole thing
        is actually real . . . surely this is true happiness.
