        She wants to go for a walk-I know what that means.&nbsp; After practice
        I'll have to walk to her house because I told her I would.&nbsp; Of
        course there was a time I would attempt to ignore it all; hoping my
        problems would dissolve into nothing, but I promised myself against
        that.&nbsp; I walk out to the track with my friend and we warm up
        together just like any other day.&nbsp; I have no problem hiding from him
        the fact that something is bothering me.&nbsp; He doesn't need to know
        anyway.&nbsp; The regular routine continues and then the team scatters to
        its separate events.&nbsp; The excitement of obtaining a new personal best
        takes my mind off the business I know I have to attend to after
        practice.&nbsp; This is good-I don't know what I'd do if someone asked me
        what's wrong.

        Leaving the locker room again, this time dressed less appropriate for
        athletics, I turn left rather than my usual right.&nbsp; I know my friend
        notices, but he doesn't say anything.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; I don't want to
        explain to him.&nbsp; He probably thinks I'm going to see a girl, but he
        doesn't know the reason.&nbsp; It's only a few blocks to her house.&nbsp;
        I ring the doorbell and stop breathing.&nbsp; This is not a time to be
        human-I have to be stronger.&nbsp; She comes to the door and invites me
        in.&nbsp; She takes my backpack from my shoulders and lays it on the
        chair-I have to remember to get it before I leave, which also means I'll
        have to come back to her house.&nbsp; I'm not sure I want to do
        that.&nbsp; She's in the best position to hurt me and I have a feeling
        I'll want to go home and hide from the pain as soon as it's over.
      </p>

      <p>
        I sneak a couple quick breaths while she's not looking.&nbsp; She turns
        back to me and we stand facing each other.&nbsp; No words are spoken, we
        just look at each other.&nbsp; I know she thinks by not saying anything
        that I won't know what she's thinking, but the pain in her eyes gives her
        away.&nbsp; She's always told me how she admired my eyes, but never
        bothered to learn how to read them.&nbsp; I've hidden my emotions for as
        long as I can remember, but the stronger ones still show in my
        eyes.&nbsp; Like right now.

        After an uncomfortable, breathless eternity, one of her eyebrows raises
        slightly.&nbsp; "Let's go for a walk."&nbsp; I now remember she hadn't
        exactly said she wanted to go for a walk, but somehow I knew it was
        coming.&nbsp; My time with her equated "let's talk" with "let's go for a
        walk."&nbsp; This is not good.&nbsp; We leave her house and start down
        the street.&nbsp; I put my hands in my pockets in silent subtle protest
        of what appears to be coming.&nbsp; She doesn't notice.&nbsp; Her arm
        hooks around mine, yet she still says nothing.&nbsp; I don't even look at
        her anymore-I know her eyes still show her anxiety for what she feels she
        must do.&nbsp; We continue walking in silence, occasionally interrupted
        by her "I don't want to do this."&nbsp; Then don't.&nbsp; But I know
        enough to not say anything.&nbsp; I just gently squeeze her arm so she
        knows I hear.&nbsp; We stop at the corner about halfway around the block
        from her house.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Talk to me," I push gently, now facing her and looking directly into her
        eyes.&nbsp; I erase from my eyes any notion of what's going through my
        heart and mind, but she wouldn't know anyway-it makes no difference.&nbsp;
        She puts her arms around me and my hands come out of my pockets so I can
        reciprocate.&nbsp; The wind blows across my fingers, sending a chill
        through my body.&nbsp; I realize that maybe she thought my hands were in
        my pockets because of the temperature.&nbsp; Maybe she just didn't
        notice-it doesn't matter.&nbsp; Her head rests on my shoulder and her
        lips begin to move.&nbsp; I can hear her perfectly, yet I have no idea
        as to which words she might be using-I understand only the ideas.&nbsp;
        Strange--who'd ever heard of a break up when the two were in each other's
        arms?
      </p>

      <p>
        "I will always love you," she says through the slow-streaming tears that
        managed to find their way to her cheeks.&nbsp; At this point my hands are
        on her shoulders so I can see her eyes.&nbsp; She looks past me over my
        shoulder or down at our feet.&nbsp; The pain in her eyes now infers a
        different meaning to me.&nbsp; She doesn't want to hurt me.&nbsp; She
        really does love me, and she doesn't lie that it will last forever.&nbsp;
        But she broke up with me-why is she the one crying?&nbsp; Isn't that my
        job in this situation?&nbsp; I gently kiss her forehead and tell her it's
        alright.&nbsp; Now this definitely is not the way to break up with
        someone.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Let's get you inside."&nbsp; I leave one arm around her shoulder and we
        walk back to her house.&nbsp; It must appear to anyone who might pass by
        as if I was the one who broke up with her rather than what actually took
        place.&nbsp; Here I am doing my best to comfort the girl who just dumped
        me.&nbsp; I turn and look at her.&nbsp; She's wiping away her tears,
        trying to make it look like nothing's wrong, but another look into her
        eyes makes me realize something.&nbsp; I stop walking.
      </p>

      <p>
        She turns toward me.&nbsp; "What?"&nbsp; I stand there for a moment just
        looking into her eyes with a rather blank look upon my face.&nbsp;
        Something there fills the emptiness that had burdened me since she told
        me we needed to talk and the corners of my mouth slowly curl upward.&nbsp;
        She hugs me and we start walking again.&nbsp; It appears that I will have
        no objection to going back to her house again.&nbsp; The world was
        mistaken once again-this is the way two people are supposed to break up.
