        little jay feverishly paced the edge of the fairway in a series of
        desperate repeated attempts to gain knowledge as to the location of his
        disc.&nbsp; finding that the six foot foliage was much too dense for his
        vision to penetrate, he added a vertical component to his movement in
        hopes that he might catch a glimpse of his wayward disc.&nbsp; much to
        his dismay, it came to his attention that due to his being little, it
        was quite impossible for his eyes to reach the altitude which would
        allow for sight above the top of the six foot foliage which might in
        turn supply little jay with the information he was after.&nbsp; at this
        point, little dan suggested that little jay actually enter the six foot
        foliage, offering use of the holy mag-lite as a persuasive element.&nbsp;
        the thought of gripping the holy mag-lite in his hands was more than
        enough motivation, so little jay grabbed the holy mag-lite and heaved
        into the six foot foliage.&nbsp; now the holy mag-lite was not expected
        to be useful as a result of its light-emitting but instead for its
        foliage-bashing qualities.&nbsp; it did, however, prove helpful to
        illuminate the area near little jay, which they most certainly should
        have been aware of when they learned that little jay could not see very
        far into the six foot foliage.&nbsp; they realized now that since sight
        worked with light rays and little jay had found himself unable to see
        very far into the six foot foliage, it quite simply followed that light
        would be able to penetrate deep enough to allow for vision when a short
        person such as little jay was moving slowly (as quickly as he could, of
        course, yet still quite slowly) through the six foot foliage.&nbsp;
        after a few days of waiting and calling out to little jay, little dan
        gave up hopes of seeing his friend again--he had most certainly been
        forever lost to the six foot foliage.&nbsp; little dan cried for three
        years over the loss before returning to his room to throw himself out
        the window due to his grief.
