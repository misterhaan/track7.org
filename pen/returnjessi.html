        "Hi Steve," said Jessi, "I'm coming back." She hung up the phone
        before the author had a chance to realize that phones don't work
        from story to story. Jessi was sick of the story she'd been living
        in, so she decided to go home. She took out the map The J had given
        her two stories ago and figured out which way she needed to go. She
        started walking and a cute little bunny jumped out in front of her.
        Being as sick of cute little forest creatures as she was, she gave
        it a powerful kick and it flew into a nearby pond. She was sick of
        ponds too.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        After walking for about ten minutes, she reached into her pocket for
        her map. "Oh yeah," she said, remembering that she still had it in
        her hand from about ten minutes ago. She looked at the map and found
        she needed to go up. She grabbed a nearby tree and used it to fling
        her up into the next story.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Jessi didn't think this was the story the map said it should it be,
        but she took out her scotch tape and fixed the hole in the paper
        anyway. She walked past a guy with a big dent in his head. She
        noticed his name tag that said "Pick 'N' Save, Hello my name is
        MIKE." There was a phone next to him and a news crew was filming
        him. She walked a little further and sat down on what seemed like a
        curb because the author had run out of things to do with her for
        now.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "She's going the wrong way," the Jay was telling the Curt in the
        story Jessi was trying to get to. The Jay and the Puddy had traveled
        to many other stories to get the technology the Jay needed to make
        his computer be able to track characters through other stories and a
        few other things (including computer bingo). The Jay typed something
        and the words of the story Jessi was in appeared on the screen. He
        and the Curt read it.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "She's in trouble," said the Curt. It seemed to the Jay that she was
        in danger of being hit by flying fruit. The Jay didn't understand
        exactly how that was bad, but he didn't say anything. "We have to
        send a rescue team."
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Jessi got up off the curb because the author had finally come up
        with something for her to do. She jumped and somehow got all the way
        up to the top floor of a building that had 381 floors. The guy
        inside who was talking on the phone looked out at her. He put it
        down and walked outside.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What is this standing outside of my apartment?" he said mostly just
        to himself, "People need to start skydiving somewhere else. Be
        gone." He pushed her off the building. Jessi found that she could
        somehow steer herself, and she entered an apartment through an
        already broken window. Nobody was there, so she left and went back
        down to the street.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Was that Jay and Curt she saw down the street? Or was it the Jay and
        the Curt and they had somehow managed to keep their definite
        articles? What was she thinking? She didn't know what a definite
        article was anyway. If they were Jay and Curt (or the Jay and the
        Curt), it was too bad because she wasn't going that way. She turned
        on her heel and walked away.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Where are they?" asked the Steve.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I don't know," said the Puddy, "I don't know how this thing works."
        She was sitting at the Jay's computer. The Steve was pacing back and
        forth. He threw his pencil and it ended up in the pencil sharpener.
        The J had taught him the gay art of pencil throwing a few stories
        ago.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Get up," said the Steve, "let me try it." The Puddy got up and he
        sat down. He started typing things and told the Puddy that they
        weren't quite to the other story yet. He just made that up though,
        because he was really doing something else.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Hey, look at that guy," said the Jay, who was looking at the guy
        with the dent in his head. Two men and a cloud walked out of the
        building they were standing in front of. The Jay and the Curt
        thought they looked familiar, but they had no idea where they might
        have seen them before. The two men introduced themselves as Curt and
        Jay. The cloud yelled at the Jay when he called it Odin because
        really it was Zeus. The Jay didn't like being yelled at, so he got
        out his magical glowing stick, which was yellow because it made the
        best flavor of life savers, and sliced the cloud in half.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I DO NOT APPRECIATE THAT," rumbled the cloud as it surfed--surfed?
        It did kind of look like Zeus on a surfboard. So anyway, it surfed
        upwards to find a certain lady cloud it had been looking at before.
        Just then, the Jay remembered that they would have brought their
        calculator looking things with them. He reached into his pocket and
        took his out.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What is that thing?" asked Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I don't know," said the Jay, "the author has never mentioned any
        name for it. All he's said is that they look like calculators." The
        Jay punched buttons on his calculator looking thing. He gave it a
        look that seemed like it wasn't functioning correctly. Really it
        was, but let's not tell him. He smacked the side of it, but it
        didn't help any.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Not working?" asked Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Guess not," said the Jay. "Maybe you can tell me who that is." He
        pointed to the guy with the dent in his head. They heard sirens in
        the background.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Uh-oh," said Curt. Just then, a huge man with a gorilla like face
        came out of the building and started chasing them down the street.
        It was too bad for the Jay and the Curt that they were going in the
        direction the Jessi wasn't.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Steve!" yelled the Puddy, "You broke it!" She was right, but she
        didn't know that he had done it on purpose. Just then, a prune came
        flying in through the window. It screeched to a halt in the middle
        of the room and looked at them with one eye.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh," it said in the politest voice possible for a prune that had
        just flown in through the window, "I'm sorry, I must have the wrong
        story." It started to go back, but it noticed the Jay's computer.
        "Ooh," it said, "mind if I use that computer to find out how to get
        to the right story?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Steve broke it. Sorry." The prune flew back out the window. The
        Puddy sat down at the computer and tried to fix it. Just then, the
        Paul walked in. They were surprised to see him, since he hadn't been
        in the last few stories.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What's going on here?" he asked.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "He broke the computer," said the Puddy, pointing at the Steve. The
        Paul glared at the Steve and then told the Puddy how the Steve was
        mad at The J and the Jay for bringing the Curt along for all the fun
        stuff when he was the one who brought the Curt into the story
        anyway. They locked the Steve in the closet and the Paul tried to
        fix the computer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Hey, wait a minute," said Curt. He stopped running and so did the
        other three. "Where's the huge man with a gorilla like face?" They
        looked back and saw that he wasn't there. They sat down and Jay
        explained the huge man with a gorilla like face (who could very
        possibly be Nathan but we're not allowed to disclose that
        information) and also the guy with the dent in his head. The Jay
        took apart his calculator looking thing and looked at it. A lady
        cloud followed by the Zeus cloud whizzed past them.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I'm going to have to get back to my story and fix my computer so we
        can find our friend," said the Jay, "You could come too if you
        want."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Yeah," said the Curt, "they could even join the ISAAESH."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Curt told them that they wanted to join the ISAAESH, but they
        couldn't leave their story at the time. They also told what they
        knew of Jessi. The Jay and the Curt went back home through a great
        white doorway.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Hey, you're back," said the Puddy as the Jay and the Curt stepped
        through the great white doorway into the room.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What about my back?" asked the Jay as he looked at his back. The
        Curt shut the great white door and it disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What's with the big white doorway?" asked the Puddy.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "It's a great white doorway," said the Jay, "but I have no idea
        where it came from."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "It saved us time and scotch tape," said the Curt, "Who cares where
        it came from?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The Paul turned from the computer. "The Steve broke your computer. I
        tried to fix it, but I haven't been successful." He got up and the
        Jay sat down.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "He deleted my free space," said the Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What does that mean?" asked the Paul.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "It means it's harder to get bingo," the Curt explained. The Jay
        fixed it, but the computer still wouldn't work.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh yeah," he said as he reached around to the back and flipped a
        switch from 'BROKEN' to 'FIXED.'
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Where is the Steve anyway?" asked the Curt. They heard a loud
        banging sound coming from the closet.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "YOU!" yelled the Steve, "It's all YOUR fault! I never should have
        brought you here!" They ignored him and made sure the calculator
        looking things worked before the Jay and the Curt set off to find
        Jessi once again. They had to walk because they didn't know how the
        great white doorway worked.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The Paul and the Puddy thought about what to do about the Steve.
        They got him to calm down and promised he'd be an important
        character in the next story. He seemed happy with that, and since
        the Paul had been forgiven for what he'd done to The J, they decided
        to forget the whole thing. The Puddy went to move her stuff into the
        Jay's house since the Jessi would probably want her old house back,
        but mostly because the Puddy and the Jessi didn't know each other.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "This is the place," said Jay as he put away his calculator looking
        thing. He and Curt jumped up and dove at the ground. The paper
        ripped and they fell on the ground of the story Jessi was in. Their
        definite articles returned as they fell. Jay and Curt walked over to
        them as they got up and dusted themselves off.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hello, Jay and Curt," said Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hello, Jay and Curt," said the Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hello, Jays and Curts," said the Zeus cloud. He saw lady cloud and
        surfed away after her again.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "So how's your upsurge thing coming?" asked the Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Never mind that for now," said the Jay. He took two calculator
        looking things out of his pocket and handed them to Curt and Jay.
        "We had a few extras of these lying around. You'll find they're
        simple to use. They'll tell you anything you want to know about the
        story you're in unless your author doesn't want you to know. We'll
        get shoe rockets and magical glowing sticks and belt-mount scotch
        tape dispensers for you later. And if you find out anything more
        about our friend, use those calculator looking things to tell us."
        The Jay and the Curt walked off.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The Curt hit his calculator looking thing. "Either they broke your
        computer again or author doesn't want us to know exactly where Jessi
        is--all I'm getting is that she's in this story." He noticed a news
        report on a TV in a nearby window. They walked over to the window
        and watched.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Was that Jessi?" asked the Jay. They had seen someone get hit by a
        flying lemon. They started to run, but they hit a large, invisible
        object. "I guess that's the wrong way," said the Jay. They turned
        around and ran the other way.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The Curt looked down into the enormous crater. "It's HUUUUUUUUUUGE!"
        he said. Jessi was still falling into it (these craters were quite
        deep). The Jay reached into his pocket and took out a remote control
        like the kind for a VCR.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Where did this come from?" The Curt didn't know either. The Jay
        aimed the remote at the Curt. Now the author knew it was very
        dangerous for any character to have that particular remote, but he
        still had the utmost power of the author's pencil. If the Jay would
        have pressed the STOP button while it was aimed at anyone, that
        character could never be even mentioned in a story ever again. If it
        wasn't aimed at anyone, the story would end right then and there and
        couldn't have a sequel. But none of that happened. The Jay pressed
        the PAUSE button and the Curt stopped moving. Then he paused the
        Jessi who stopped falling into the unknown depths of the crater.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That was cool," he said. He looked at the remote. There was
        something on the back that said "Important Channels." His home story
        along with the one he was in then were listed. He aimed at the Curt
        again and typed the three-digit code for their home story. The Curt
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Cool," said the Jay. He pointed the remote down the crater at Jessi
        and typed the code. Nothing happened, so he tried it again. It still
        didn't work, so he said, "I guess it doesn't work if the person is
        in danger." Actually, that had nothing to do with it. It was just
        that the author wasn't letting it work on her. The Jay used the
        remote to send himself back to his home story.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "What happened to the Curt?" asked the Paul.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
       "Oh yeah." The Jay unpaused the Curt. "We need to rescue Jessi from
        falling into a deep, unknown crater."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "You just left her falling into a deep, unknown crater?" asked the
        Puddy.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh no, she's paused," said the Jay. "We'll need-"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I don't think we should save her," said the Paul, "She won't do any
        more damage to that story and she wasn't a very good character
        anyway. She was based on a mix between Jess and Jessie--what kind of
        character is that? The rest of us are whole. We should just leave
        her alone."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "But if we left her alone the story would end right here and that's
        a rather stupid ending," said the Curt, "I'm sure our author won't
        allow that." That convinced them. They all went to the junkyard to
        build a machine that would save Jessi and bring her back. They could
        get rid of her in the next story if they wanted to. The Jay used the
        fast-forward button on the remote to get them to the junkyard
        faster.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "I like to play in the junkyard," said the Paul who had a dirty
        toilet seat around his neck.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
       "Where's the rest of that toilet?" asked the Curt, "We need it for
        our machine." The Paul brought the rest of the toilet over to where
        everyone else was making the machine. The Curt took the flusher
        handle off and attached it to the machine. The Jay used the remote
        to send the machine, the Curt, and himself back to the other story.
        The Paul decided to keep the toilet seat. He and the Puddy went back
        to the ISAAESH control room.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Okay, Curt, flush." The Curt pulled the flusher handle and the
        machine started working. The Jay sat at the fine-tuning knobs (from
        an old TV) so he could make sure the giant hand got to the right
        place before it closed. The Curt walked to the crater and peered
        over the edge.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Just a little more to the left," he said, "No--my left. Okay. I'm
        closing the hand...there. Bring her up." The Curt really couldn't
        have reached the control that closed the hand from the edge of the
        crater, but the author didn't realize what he was doing until he'd
        already done it. The hand was above the top of the crater. It swung
        around to where Jessi was above solid ground. The Curt opened the
        hand and Jessi just kept floating there.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Close the hand again," said the Jay, "I have to unpause her first."
        The Curt closed the hand again and the Jay unpaused Jessi. "Okay."
        The hand opened and Jessi fell on the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Thanks, guys," said Jessi as she got up. She noticed a stampede of
        reporters raising a cloud of dust off in the distance. The other two
        noticed it too. The remote had mysteriously disappeared, so they
        ran. It didn't take long until they got to where the Jay and the
        Curt had fallen about three pages back. They each held one of
        Jessi's arms and pressed the buttons on their shoes. They had to go
        up for a long time before they entered the next story. Curt
        scotch-taped the rip.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        The Puddy opened the door and let the Steve out of the closet
        because they forgot to do that before. She took out her calculator
        looking thing and pressed some buttons. "They could be back any
        Minute Now, " she said."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Why didn't you just use that instead of the computer before?" asked
        the Paul.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "The author must've forgot about it for a while." The Jay, the Curt,
        and the Jessi fell on the floor. They all talked for a while and
        found out that Jessi had been holding the map upside down.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Why isn't the story over yet?" asked the Curt, "We usually go off
        and rescue one of our characters and when we come back that's it."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Maybe the author fell asleep," suggested the Jay, "HEY! WAKE UP,
        author! " The author woke up."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Maybe that didn't work," said the Paul, "it still isn't over yet."
        So far the author had no idea what was going on. A ceiling tile fell
        on the floor and exploded, knocking all of them down.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "He's awake," said the Jay, "Jessi, tell him you're here."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I'm here," said the Jessi. The author now knew what was going on.
        Two magical glowing sticks fell from the ceiling.
