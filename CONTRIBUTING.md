thanks for your interest in track7!

as this is the source code for my personal website, all the non-library code comes from me.  while you are still welcome to fork the project, i will not accept any pull requests.

i use the [issues](https://github.com/misterhaan/track7.org/issues) as a todo list.  feel free to comment on existing issues that are important to you or create new issues for bug reports and suggestions.  if youâ€™d rather send something to me privately, you can use the [track7 messaging system](http://www.track7.org/user/messages.php#!to=misterhaan).
