        "hmm, my mountain dew seems to be frozen," said little joey.&nbsp;
        little timothy suggested that he take the bottle down the hall and
        microwave it, or at least set the refrigerator less cold.&nbsp;
        little stephanie reminded them all that you shouldn't put metal in
        the microwave, which everyone knew anyway, so little timothy kindly
        tossed her out the window.&nbsp; little joey then took his frozen
        mountain dew and went down the hall with it.&nbsp; back in the
        room, little timothy decided he might jump on the bed, but being
        little he found no way even to get up to the bed, much less jump
        once he got there.&nbsp; as he stood in the middle of the floor
        pondering this lack of way, little joey returned with his now
        thawed mountain dew.&nbsp; "it worked!" he proclaimed, throwing his
        hands into the air triumphantly.&nbsp; little did he know, however,
        that his right hand clutched a de"cap"itated (sorry, couldn't
        resist) bottle of mountain dew, which wasted no time in drenching
        its surroundings, including little timothy.&nbsp; at this little
        timothy became quite infuriated--his face reddened deeply and his
        body heated enough so that the mountain dew which so carelessly had
        come to rest upon him evaporated, greeting them with a peculiar
        odor.&nbsp; this odor, strange as it was, caused little joey to
        mistakenly accuse little timothy of flatulence, which only served
        to anger him further, this time to the point where he unkindly
        tossed little joey out the window.&nbsp; "he can keep her company,"
        said little timothy, referring to little stephanie.&nbsp; just
        then, big dan appeared in the doorway, and upon seeing the
        unconfined mountain dew became quite militant, digging in the couch
        to find fossilized cheetos which he threw at little timothy.&nbsp;
        after one of these fossilized cheetos had become wedged in little
        timothy 's left nostril, little timothy flew into a fit of rage over
        having been assaulted with two different forms of junk food in a
        short period of time.&nbsp; big dan surmised that this was likely a
        dangerous situation because one with the title of big knew enough
        stuff to go around making surmisions.&nbsp; acting upon his
        surmision, which is generally the next step, big dan picked up
        little timothy by a wedgie and gently tossed him out the window to
        join his friends, lying on the ground four stories below.&nbsp;
        then big jay walked in and inquired as to the purpose of the
        scattered beverage and infinitely stale cheetos, to which big dan
        replied, "it was his fault," pointing out the window to the three
        children piled below it.&nbsp; big jay casually sauntered up to the
        window and ponderously placed his left hand upon his chin.&nbsp;
        "hmm," said he, "all this over a frozen mountain dew..."

        after the shock of the recent happenings had for the most part worn
        off, big jay sat down in his broken chair (apparently it had been
        struck by an unbelievably stale cheeto).&nbsp; "poor kathy; she
        never gets any e-mail," he thought to himself, and in a sudden
        stroke of genius which followed shortly after his unspoken
        conversation with himself, he realized he did in fact have the
        power to change that.&nbsp; and so he did just that, ignoring big
        dan 's tauntingly cruel remarks which were being flung out the
        window at the corpse of little timothy which lie motionless at a
        lower elevation.
