        The J had finally figured it out. Since it was just a story and not
        the real world, you couldn't really "dig all the way to china," but
        you would just dig through the bottom of the story instead. He
        picked up his phone to call the Jessi and tell her about it, but
        nobody answered. He decided to call the Steve, who was a ghost ever
        since the Paul killed him in a pencil fight.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hello," said the Steve.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hi," said The J, "Have you seen the Jessi around lately?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "No, but I wanted to ask you if I could bring another character into
        the story, " said the Steve.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh yeah sure, go ahead," The J told him, "but call me if you see
        the Jessi."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay, bye." The Steve reached up out of the story into the real
        world and pulled Curtis into the story with him. "Yippee!" said the
        Steve, "Now we have a Curt!"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Now the Curt was really smart, close to The J, so he figured out a
        lot of stuff about the story. It also helped that he'd read some of
        the other stories that came before this one. He knew that the author
        is an idiot and thinks that the same thing happening in two stories
        is perfectly okay, so he figured that someone had to be lost in
        another story in need of rescuing. He went to The J's house. This
        paragraph was starting to get a little long, so he said something.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hey, J," he said, "I just made a long paragraph."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Good for you," said The J.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I got a question," said the Curt, "I was wondering if you died
        after the end of that last story or not, I couldn't tell."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh, yeah," said the Jay, "but it's cool since I'm a ghost now."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Like the Steve and the Ooo Ooy?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Not the Ooo Ooy," said The J, "I drowned him in the next story down
        since I was mad at him for killing me and the Jessi. But it's
        awesome to be a ghost, since I can still do everything I could do
        before and walk through walls and float in the air as an added
        bonus."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Yeah, that's great," said the Curt, "but right now we should go get
        the Jessi and bring her back."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Where is she?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "She's in the next story down," said the Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh," said the J, who understood how the Curt could have figured it
        out, "Come in here, You need something to drink."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        They went into The J's kitchen and the Curt had a glass of Death
        Drink. He instantly died and became a ghost. "Are you ready to go,
        or are you going to need to get used to the ghost thing first?"
        asked The J.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Let's go," said the Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        They floated down through the ground because ghosts can do that, and
        after a while, their heads stuck through the bottom of the story.
        Then they were in the top of the next story down. They slowly
        floated down into the story and their clothes turned into blue
        cloaks and blue pointy hats with moons and stars on them. Magic
        wands and scrolls formed in their hands. They started falling, so
        Curtlin checked his scroll for a spell to help them. They hit the
        ground just after he found it.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh well," said Jalin, "It didn't really hurt much anyway."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Just a minute," said Curtlin, "I need to find out what our names
        are in this story." He found an answer spell and cast it on himself.
        "The answer is 5,496.43," he said, "Oh, I guess that was the wrong
        spell."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Let me try one," said Jalin, "Here's an anti-forgot-my-name spell."
        He cast it on both of them. "Hello. My name is Jalin."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hello. My name is Curtlin."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "So we're probably looking for Jessilin." Curtlin nodded. Jalin
        looked in his scroll and cast a spell on a dandelion. It went"POOF!"
        and turned into a person.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Would you happen to know of a wizard named Jessilin?" asked Jalin.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Yes," said the dandelion-man, "and I can take you to her if you'd
        like."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The dandelion-man took them into the nearest city. Then he took them
        to where Jessilin lived. Jalin turned him back into a dandelion and
        poofed a flower pot around him. Curtlin picked it up and stashed it
        in his cloak. They went inside, but nobody was there.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "There's nobody here," said Curtlin. Jalin looked around a little to
        make sure Curtlin was right, and he was.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Great," said Jalin, "now we have to go looking for her." They left
        for the castle since they figured SOMEBODY there could help them.
        Curtlin rang the doorbell. The drawbridge dropped on them and a
        guard walked out. He looked around and saw no one.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Darn kids," he mumbled as he went back inside. With the drawbridge
        not on them, Jalin and Curtlin put their thumbs in their mouths and
        blew. They inflated back to non-pancake shape.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Cool," said Curtlin, "it's like in the cartoons." Jalin was looking
        at a poster on the drawbridge. It said Today's Schedule on the top
        and he noticed that Jessilin was scheduled to be burnt at the stake
        in--he checked his watch--45 minutes! "That's right," said Curtlin,
        "there weren't any girl wizards, they were witches." The two blue
        wizards checked their scrolls and then decided to go to the local
        magic shop.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "I'm sorry, mister, but my boss says I have to charge fifty gold
        pieces for these--there's no way I can just give them to you."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I'll handle this, Curtlin," said Jalin. He waved his wand and said
        some nonsense words. One hundred gold pieces poofed above the boy,
        and since this story had gravity, he was buried by them.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Keep the change," said Curtlin as he took the black cloaks and hats
        and left with Jalin. They went back to Jessilin's house, locked the
        doors, pulled the shades, and turned on the security system.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hey author!" yelled Jalin, "Why the heck did we just buy these
        black hats and cloaks for?" They stuck their hands up the black
        pointed hats and felt tags, so they turned them inside-out. The tags
        read: MAGIC BLACK POINTY HAT AND CLOAK TO ACTIVATE CAST SPELL ON
        REVERSE SIDE.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh," said Jalin, "sorry I doubted you, author. "They put on the
        black cloaks and hats. Curtlin cast the spell from inside the hats.
        We'd tell you what exactly he said, but the hat and cloak
        manufacturer said that the hats and cloaks wouldn't sell anymore if
        people knew the spell.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Nothing happened," said Curtlin, "let's go get our money back."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "No way, Curtlin," said Jalin, "you're invisible .Besides, it wasn't
        our money anyway."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I don't think so," said Curtlin after looking at his hands that he
        could see. He was really invisible, but when you're invisible, you
        can see invisible things.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Trust me." Jalin cast the spell on himself. "Come back to the
        castle with me and I'll prove it." They went to the castle and Jalin
        made faces at everyone along the way and nobody seemed to notice
        either of them. When they got to the castle, they couldn't decide
        what to do, but the drawbridge opened and two guards walked out and
        stood on it. Jalin and Curtlin took this opportunity to get inside.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        When they found the dungeon where Jessilin was being held, Curtlin
        found the keys lying on a shelf. He quietly lifted them off and
        unlocked the door to Jessilin's cell. Jalin cast the invisibility
        spell on her and put his finger to his lips to keep her from waking
        the guard. (Why is it that prison guards are always sleeping?) Jalin
        went to the throne room and Curtlin and Jessilin waited in the
        dungeon.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Yaaaahhh!" he yelled, "Ieeeee! Booga-booga! Blaaaah! Eeeek!" The
        guards from all over the castle ran in there to investigate. All
        three invisible friends made their way to the drawbridge. Jessilin
        noticed a switch that was on closed, so she pulled it to open. The
        drawbridge dropped and they ran out of the castle. Curtlin made sure
        to drop the keys on the drawbridge in case they had a real bad guy to
        lock up.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        When they were back at the place where Jalin and Curtlin had landed,
        Curtlin put the pot back where the dandelion came from. Jalin poofed
        away the pot. "Always replace your divots," he said. Curtlin cast a
        levitation spell and they all floated upwards until their clothes
        went back to normal. The scrolls and wands disintegrated and they
        were ghosts again.
