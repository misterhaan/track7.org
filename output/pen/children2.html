        little kathy carried the shoe up to the desk, followed by little jay,
        who was there for moral support.&nbsp; she inquired as to the
        availability of a certain size of the purple shoe which had caught her
        eye.&nbsp; the girl behind the desk took from little kathy the shoe and
        disappeared into the back of the store, proclaiming authoritatively that
        she would find out.&nbsp; and so little kathy and little jay presumed to
        wander about the little store, half-pretending to peruse the remainder
        of the shoe displays.&nbsp; they only half-pretended because the
        pretending half prevented them from being asked to leave, and the
        non-pretending half served as protection from strangers offering to help
        them, which little kathy did not want to happen--seeing that strangers
        are not to be talked to, while also it is rude to not answer when asked
        a question.&nbsp; and thus they continued their half-charade of perusing
        while they waited upon the desk girl's return.&nbsp; after a great deal
        of time, it seemed as though the desk girl may never return, which
        caused some amount of restlessness in little jay.&nbsp; it seemed that
        no matter what little kathy said or did, little jay would not cease his
        running frantically about the store. just then, the desk girl appeared
        from the back, holding the purple shoe, though little kathy
        disappointedly noticed that the desk girl did not carry with her a box
        containing two similar shoes in little kathy's size.&nbsp; the desk girl
        elaborated that she had been unsuccessful in her search of the back of
        the store for the purple footwear that would fit little kathy.&nbsp;
        this did not fool little kathy, however, since she was wise enough to
        ascertain that the unnaturally long length of time which the desk girl
        had so carelessly expended in the back of the store was not actually
        spent in search of the shoes, but rather in mocking torment aimed at
        little kathy.&nbsp; at this little jay flew into a fit of rage, after
        which he quickly became quite violent.&nbsp; he wandered slowly over to
        little kathy and politely asked her if he might be allowed to borrow her
        collection of dairy queen spoons.&nbsp; little kathy, not understanding
        what exactly it was that little jay was about to do, told him to go
        ahead.&nbsp; and so little jay borrowed little kathy 's dairy queen
        spoon collection, one spoon of which he grasped angrily in his right
        hand, clutching the others in his left.&nbsp; he began to repeatedly
        step menacingly in the direction of the desk girl, still angrily
        gripping the spoon in his right hand.&nbsp; once he surmised that he was
        within spooning range, little kathy watched in horror and amazement as
        little jay's rage compelled him to quite gruesomely reduce the desk girl
        to a plethora of scoopings piled on the floor next to him.&nbsp; little
        jay returned what was left of the collection of dairy queen spoons to
        little kathy, apologizing for those spoons which had not survived the
        ordeal.&nbsp; he then asked her to help him carry the pieces of the desk
        girl (which he fully intended to place inside a plastic bag first) up
        some stairs so that he might throw her out a window.
