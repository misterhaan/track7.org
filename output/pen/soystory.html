        "Hey cool, I got a package," Jay announced with great glee to nobody
        in particular as he took the little yellow slip from his mailbox.
        Unfortunately, since nobody was at the desk until 4:00, he had to
        wait another hour to claim his package, so he walked up the three
        and a half flights of stairs to his room and checked his e-mail. The
        excitement from having a package soon faded when he noticed that he
        noticed that he hadn't heard from Kathy since Wednesday night, and
        it was Friday already. He began to feel quite alone since his
        roommate had already gone home for the weekend, depressing him to a
        point where he actually started doing calculus. After a short time,
        Jay had done every problem in the book, so he looked up at the
        clock. It was 4:30, so his excitement returned as he floated swiftly
        down the stairs. It had been quite some time since he had gotten
        mail of any kind, let alone a package.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        He walked up and greeted the girl at the desk. "I'm offended by your
        nakedness , " she responded. Jay protested her offense, stating that"
        he was not naked. "Well you're half naked . . . "
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        " . . . Then you can only be half offended. Might I have this
        package?" and handed her the yellow slip. She found a quite large
        box and wheeled it around to him.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "This thing weighs about a hundred pounds," she complained. So Jay
        wheeled his package until he go to the stairs, at which point he
        realized that it was quite impossible to roll a hundred-pound
        package up four flights of stairs. "Oh by the way," called the girl
        from behind the desk, "happy birthday." Jay thanked her politely and
        proceeded to open the package right there at the bottom of the
        stairs.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What took you so long?" asked the girl from inside the box, "They
        opened the desk at least a half hour ago." She stood up, put her
        hands on her hips, and frowned at him. Jay recognized her and
        smiled.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Wow, this is exactly what I wanted for my birthday! Somebody
        deserves a really nice thank-you note," he exclaimed as he checked
        the box flaps for a return address. The girl smiled and he lifted
        her out of the box and ran her up to his room, leaving the box at
        the bottom of the stairs since someone would have to pick it up, and
        it might not be him.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        After doing some things that will go unmentioned due to the
        possibility that this may end up as a children's story, Jay
        suggested that they go for a walk. Looking outside and seeing that
        it was a nice warm day for fall, Kathy agreed. And so they put some
        warm clothes on (warm for fall still calls for warm clothes) and
        went outside. Jay thought that maybe the nature trail would be a
        good place to begin the walk, so that's where he led her. They
        walked hand in hand or otherwise connected, smiling, talking, and
        laughing as they went.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        They passed a few benches as they walked, and Kathy eventually
        suggested that they sit down, which they did. The bench was
        positioned nearby and facing the woods, with an open field
        stretching uphill behind it. Jay was made nervous by the openness,
        but he didn't care all that much since he was with Kathy. After a
        while, he noticed what appeared to be partially melted snow on the
        grass, which he began staring at, pondering the possibility of snow
        when it hadn't snowed since early last spring.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What?" asked Kathy, wondering why he was staring. Jay didn't
        answer, but she followed his gaze and also became locked in a stare
        focused on the snow-like substance. Jay slowly got to his feet and
        Kathy did likewise. Then they both looked to the side because
        someone had bumped into them. Whoever that had been tipped his hat
        and bowed an apology to the both of them, then continued merrily
        along his way. Jay grumbled something about distance runners and
        turned his attention back to the snow stuff, only to find that it
        was no longer there. Kathy suggested the possibility that it had
        melted, but Jay surmised that the guy who had bumped into them had
        stolen it.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Sure-it's a conspiracy," teased Kathy, "Snow's real popular these
        days -I 'll bet the street value of that stuff's a couple hundred at
        least." They then heard a sound closely resembling that of ripping
        paper and a new man wearing a trench coat ran up to them. He took a
        device from inside his coat. Jay noticed the words "Microsoft TI98"
        written on it.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I'm too late," said the new man. He turned his eyes upward. "If
        you 're going to call me that, could I maybe FEEL like a new man?" He
        punched up something on his TI98 and showed it to Jay and Kathy.
        "Let me know if you recognize any of these people." The TI98 was
        cycling through mug shots of numerous people. Jay wondered who this
        guy was and whether or not he was worthy of their assistance. "Yes,
        I apologize for not introducing myself-we're running a bit
        short-handed," said the new man, "I am Steve, leader of ISAAESH."
        That was enough for Jay, and just as he turned back to the TI98,
        Kathy recognized the man who had bumped into them before.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "He's a criminal?" she asked, "He seemed so friendly and polite . .
        ."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Yeah, but that snow stuff disappeared shortly after he did . . ."
        Jay pointed out. Steve questioned them both about the incident and
        seemed slightly upset by what they told him. He sat down on the
        bench and took on a look of deep ponderance. Forehead still wrinkled
        in thought, he turned to his TI98 once more. "This problem is bigger
        than we at ISAAESH can handle with our current staff. Could I ask
        you two to join us? You're both able and we'll take care of any
        problems resulting from your disappearance. Are you willing?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Jay looked into Kathy's eyes and saw that she would go anywhere with
        him. He told Steve that they would do it. Steve warned them that
        much of what they would see would most likely shock and amaze them,
        as well as give them a sense that their world was not real. They
        thought that would be interesting, so Steve led them away.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Some time later Jay and Kathy woke up in an unfamiliar room. "Wow,"
        said Kathy, "your room really looked different in the dark." Jay
        knew she was kidding so he didn't bother reminding her of last
        night. They both got up and began to look around, trying to figure
        out just what it was that they were supposed to do. Just as they
        began their wondering, Steve came in and a piece of the wall slid
        aside to reveal a computer screen.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Using the screen as a visual aid, which he controlled through his
        TI98, Steve proceeded to explain to them the predicament, which
        required their assistance. He told them what ISAAESH stood for as
        well as its purpose. "What you know as the real world actually
        contains many sub-universes, product of the imaginations of your
        creative persons. These sub-universes can only exist within the
        bounds of that person's imagination, and only while in conscious
        thought unless written down. At this moment, we are in a short
        story."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "So where are we in this story?" asked Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Well, our author doesn't seem to know what happens with a story's
        timeline once the characters realize that they are part of a story,
        so the best I can tell you is that we are aboard the starship
        Happyfries."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What?" Kathy exclaimed in disbelief, "This sure doesn't seem like a
        Pastor Nancy story . . ."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I was just getting to that." Steve's expression became sterner.
        "Not long after the end of our last story, one of our characters
        became evil. Our leader at the time noticed and had Paul (the evil
        character) locked away as a precaution. One night while Puddy was on
        guard Paul made his escape, killing Puddy and merging our story line
        with the Pastor Nancy story line. All of the characters from our
        story who had a counter-character in Pastor Nancy perished when met
        by their counter-characters-like a matter/antimatter sort of thing.
        We are under the assumption that Paul figured this while he was
        locked away. Our leader and another of out top agents met this fate,
        as well as some other operatives. Unfortunately, all of the good
        guys from that story happened to be counter-characters to one of our
        people, leaving us quite short on manpower. Paul conned the Pastor
        Nancy villains into joining him, which gives us an even larger
        problem. I have taken over as leader and was going after one of
        Paul 's henchmen when I met you. They had been field-testing some
        sort of synthetic substance that we believe is intended for warfare.
        If this is the case, Paul is in violation of 17 inter-universal
        treaties and must be stopped. The reason I asked you two here is the
        old legend that our leader must be named Jay and replaced with a new
        Jay from an alternate universe when he goes bad or is destroyed. And
        Kathy . . . well you were with him." Steve stopped and sat down,
        exhausted after spouting so long a paragraph.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That was quite the paragraph," said Jay. He then became confused as
        to why he would say such a thing. Steve smiled in approval, saying
        that Jay was exactly what they needed, then he asked them to come
        with him. He brought them into a hall, which they walked down,
        considering that most people use halls for either that or cough
        relief. They eventually came to the armory and Steve brought them
        inside and opened a closet.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Each of you will need a coat of arms," he said while the closet
        door opened. Inside was a row of trench coats that looked identical
        to each other and the one Steve had been wearing when Jay and Kathy
        first met him. Kathy chose a coat and tried it on, but Jay seemed to
        just stand there. "42 long?" asked Steve, handing him a coat. After
        they both had a coat on, Steve began telling them about their arms.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        ". . . and lastly, you each have a Microsoft TI98. You will find
        this approximately chest level on your right side."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Jay and Kathy got them out and looked at them. "What good does this
        do us?" asked Kathy.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Ever seen Quantum Leap?" The both nodded. "This is like Ziggy-Al's
        little computer thing that knows everything. It's pretty easy to use
        and is one of your most important tools." Jay asked how it could
        know everything. "Thanks to English teachers, practically everything
        ever written has been analyzed. This means that while you are in a
        universe belonging to a story, or if you are checking a character
        profile of someone from such a place, any main character will have a
        rather complete profile. Every now and then, an English teacher
        assigns writing on something from Reality, so there is partial data
        on that universe." Kathy looked slightly confused, but Jay nodded in
        comprehension. "Well, I need to get back to work, so you two can
        stay here and figure those things out." And with that, Steve left.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Kathy began to figure out the workings of the TI98 while Jay used
        his own in a valiant attempt to determine what they had actually
        seen when they thought they had seen snow earlier. Kathy found the
        games on hers, which kept her occupied. Jay brought his left hand to
        his chin as he continued researching the conspiracy. "What? It
        <i>is</i> a conspiracy?" he asked.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hey, keep it down-you two don't know that yet," said the wall. They
        both cast strange looks at the wall for having spoken to them, which
        was understandably not a behavior they were used to from walls. "You
        shall neglect all knowledge of this being a conspiracy." Suddenly,
        they both noticed that they had rather deep headaches and, while
        distracted, swiftly forgot what the wall had wanted them to forget.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        After an indeterminate time of shock and amazement over the talking
        wall of which they could recall nothing, another person who neither
        Kathy nor Jay had seen before entered the room. They noticed that he
        was wearing a coat of arms and assumed that he must be a fellow
        agent, naively neglecting to consider that maybe he had recently
        defeated an agent and stolen the coat. Before anyone noticed, all
        three of them were donkeys. A short man with long hair ran through
        the room and stole the unknown person's jawbone, which he used to
        kill a great many of people. Being a good guy, this longhaired man
        replaced the jawbone when he was finished.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Just as the confusion was about to fade, a math teacher carrying a
        chalkboard entered the room. He set up and began taking the limit of
        the time equation since it had been previously named indeterminate.
        He explained how he had to go to the hospital to do this, and when
        he was done asked, "Any questions, any questions?" without turning
        around to see if there were any. The longhaired man came back to the
        scene to once again borrow the jawbone to rid them of the teacher,
        once again returning it when he was done. Then the donkey whose
        jawbone had been used as a lethal instrument against a large mass of
        people began stepping carefully on a TI98 which was lying
        conveniently in front of him.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Somewhere in reality, Steve removed his TI98 from his coat and saw
        the face of a donkey on its display. "I was afraid of this," he said
        to the bum who was asking him for money. He then offered the bum a
        shiny new dime if he would go away, which the bum graciously
        accepted, and of course proceeded to go away. Hiding behind a
        dumpster so that nobody could see, Steve simultaneously typed things
        on his TI98, chanted and danced in a circle, and asked someone's
        mother what was for dinner. "That should do it," he said upon his
        emergence from behind the dumpster. He then realized that the story
        was still talking about him, so he whined complainingly until that
        changed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        The three characters back in the armory found that they were no
        longer donkeys. They were even further relieved to see that not only
        were they no longer donkeys, but they had also become once more the
        people they had been before.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Jay?" the unnamed guy asked in surprise, "How did you survive?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Jay looked at him confusedly. "What?  Who are you?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh, so they've replaced you-er . . . him, already. I'm Captain
        Curt-you must be our new leader." Suddenly, all knowledge needed to
        lead the ISAAESH was bestowed upon Jay, which caused his person to
        emit a pulsating celestial luminance.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What? Does that mean I farted?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "No, you just looked like a slowly strobing angel or something."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh, okay." And with that, he ceased to strobe and whipped out his
        TI98. He pressed some buttons and spoke into it, "I am recalling all
        field agents working on the apprehension of Paul. Return to base
        immediately." Sam, who had been leading off, walked back and placed
        one foot on the white square. Shortly after that, the last of the
        ISAAESH agents showed up. "Isn't there anyone else?" asked Jay,
        since Steve had been the only one to return.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Most of our agents perished when we were merged with the Pastor
        Nancy series," explained Steve. "For example, when our leader Jay
        met his counter-character Sir Jay, they experienced mutually strong
        gravitational attractions to one another, formed a molten core,
        burst into flames and suddenly imploded. The whole thing is really
        quite terrible." Jay was taken slightly aback at this, but he felt
        that there was business that required attending to and decided to
        just go forward and ignore it. Steve then noticed Captain Curt,
        which was a confusing disturbance since Curt and Captain Curt should
        have perished when they met.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Jay took this opportunity to explain. "This is Captain Curt,
        counter-character of Curt. He continues to exist because Curt became
        a casualty during Paul's escape. It is my understanding that Captain
        Curt also has some information to share with us regarding Paul's
        time in the Pastor Nancy stories." Everyone looked at Jay with a
        scent of awe. Jay sniffed at the air, looked as if he were deep in
        thought, then said to himself, "Do I smell astonishment?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "He's right," said Captain Curt, getting back to the plot of the
        story , "It so happens that Paul, during his stay in the Pastor Nancy"
        universe, was in search of a thug or two who might look after him
        while he gallivanted in the real universe. He located Pastor Nancy
        as well as Mad Professor Robbie as the story's villains and asked
        them to join his evil cause. Pastor Nancy, having been a supporting
        villain in a previous story, agreed to join him, but Mad Professor
        Robbie insisted upon being the big tomato, so Paul assigned his
        elimination as Pastor Nancy's first duty. I also noticed him mention
        something about going back to the farm."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Durn blast it," said Steve, "Now he's got a whole load of farmers
        working for him." Suddenly, Allene/Puddy walked in. Everyone said
        "ah" in remembrance of her existence. Unfortunately, she was not a
        terribly useful character since her prime interest seemed to lie in
        making Jay angry with her. Apparently she failed to realize that
        this was completely impossible due to her gross insignificance in
        his eyes. But she pressed on, first insulting his clothes, which
        caused everyone else to look at one another in confusion since they
        were all wearing the same thing. The strangeness of her futile
        slander then caused every other character present to ignore her
        fully. The author chose to do the same, and she was no more.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Then was left an awkward silence of confusion, which Jay decided to
        break by saying, "I think it's time we play
        pin-the-tail-on-the-Paul." Steve interjected a comment about all of
        the characters having been stripped of their definite articles a
        story or two ago. "Anyway," continued Jay, "what we need to do is
        find Paul and track him for a while in order to find out what he's
        up to. Right now all we know is that he's evil and that his plot has
        something to do with farming. He's in the real world, which means we
        have a lot of farmers to watch. While I've been talking, I wrote a
        program for the TI98 which will alert you when Paul is in the
        vicinity. I am not sure of the range, but it should help us
        somewhat. I recommend that we split up and search for Paul. Once
        someone finds him, he must be placed under surveillance until we can
        find out what's going on."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That sounds good," said Captain Curt, "but covert missions tend to
        be dangerous. I suggest we disperse in groups to increase safety."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That only leaves us with two units," observed Jay, "but okay." And
        so Steve went off with Captain Curt and Jay went off with Kathy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Some time later, somewhere in eastern Missouri, Steve and Captain
        Curt were busy going undercover. "I wanted to be the head," whined
        Captain Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Sorry," said Steve, but I'm the one obsessed with cows-I get to be
        the head." Captain Curt found himself unable to argue against that
        without becoming obsessed with cows himself, which he saw as
        catastrophic. So Steve put on the head and Captain Curt became the
        rest of the cow. They walked over and joined the rest of the cows,
        being careful to graze and moo inconspicuously. Here, disguised by
        their cow suit and the real cows surrounding them, Captain Curt
        watched his TI98 for the presence of Paul while Steve made sure they
        were not discovered. When Steve picked out the cow costume, he had
        made sure to get an ugly cow so that he wouldn't have to deal with
        the problem of another cow finding him particularly attractive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Meanwhile, Jay and Kathy were investigating some farms in Wisconsin.
        They noticed a larger proportion of soy farms than either of them
        remembered, which aroused their suspicions toward soy. "I always
        thought soy was a durn varmint of a fruit," Jay commented.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Soy isn't a fruit, dear," Kathy corrected him.

        "Doesn't matter-still evil." And so they came to an agreement that
        soy was evil, or that it at least was being put to use in the
        advancement of evil purposes in the general region in which they
        found themselves at the time. After reading that last sentence, they
        became confused to a point where the author was forced to remind
        them that they weren't actually supposed to read the story. Jay
        argued that they would be left without knowledge of what they were
        to do if they were not allowed to read the story, so the author told
        him to shut up. To this Jay responded, "You're not the boss of me,"
        so the author shot him in the foot. Jay winced in pain, took a
        couple slow steps backward, then put his hands in the air. The
        author then left him because you don't win if you kill them all.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Remembering that they were supposed to be doing good guy stuff, more
        specifically stopping Paul and the evil soy, Kathy suggested "Why
        don 't we go back to where we saw the snow stuff?" Jay acknowledged
        the goodness of that idea and so they did just that.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Arriving some time later at the place where they had originally seen
        the snow stuff, Jay observed that wherever you go, there you are.
        Kathy called him weird and they proceeded to investigate the evility
        of soy through the discovery of the snow stuff. To their misfortune,
        there was an extreme lack of snow stuff in the area. They both
        became substantially disappointed until they observed a flying
        monkey bouncing gaily past them down the path, which caused them to
        giggle girlishly. Shortly after the monkey followed an
        intimidatingly rapid moving human-looking lady who called Kathy
        pretty before threatening to "get her," also mentioning something
        that seemed to imply that Jay was a small dog who would share in
        Kathy 's fate. Normally Jay would enjoy thinking that he would share
        in fate with Kathy, but in this case he was less than enthused due
        to the nature of that fate.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Suddenly they realized the human-looking lady who had moved so
        rapidly past them in the last paragraph was none other than Pastor
        Nancy. Remembering both that she was evil and that she was
        participating in Paul's conspiracy, Jay whipped out his magical
        glowing stick and chased after her, despite her intimidating
        rapidity. Kathy decided that she wanted to chase something too, so
        she went after the flying monkey. Jay managed to catch Pastor Nancy
        after a short time, and Kathy thought he was lucky, though he just
        thought he was fast. Kathy continued to chase the flying monkey
        while Jay held Pastor Nancy at bay. Becoming somewhat bored with
        simply standing there waiting for Kathy to capture the flying
        monkey, and having a tendency to enjoy looking at her, Jay turned
        around to see what was taking so long. Pastor Nancy took this moment
        of Jay 's inattentiveness to dive into the bay he had been holding
        her at and swim away. She began to cackle evilly as she dove, which
        became more of a gurgle as she entered the water. Jay, keeping in
        mind the possibility of flying feces in the presence of monkey
        creatures, as well as his lack of experience with magical glowing
        sticks in water, decided to let her escape.

      <p class="story">
        Meanwhile, aboard the Happyfries, Captain Curt was diligently trying
        to remember whether or not he was in the story. Suddenly, a small
        green space man appeared in the air, floating slightly above Captain
        Curt 's shoulder. Captain Curt responded to this appearance by
        calling the man's name, to which a nearby female said, "bless you,"
        offering a tissue. Keeping in mind the insignificance of females, or
        rather nameless characters, Captain Curt lightly brushed her aside
        as if she were merely a fly on his apple pie. The small space man
        then reminded Captain Curt that he was, in fact, part of the story,
        and he was supposed to be helping to put an end to Paul's evility.
        Captain Curt thanked him and offered him some apple pie, which the
        green man declined, mentioning something about a fly having been on
        it. He then disappeared-much in the way he had appeared, but in
        reverse. Captain Curt was slightly disappointed now that the space
        man was gone. He then decreed that graphics class should never last
        more than one hour, out of respect for Kevin. And so it was, and
        Captain Curt departed the scene.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Steve lifted his head from the grass to moo loudly at the farmer who
        was poking him in the shoulder. His moo must've been quite realistic
        since the farmer didn't seem to notice any difference, though he did
        inform Steve of his lack of a rear half.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Dad-burn it!  Y'ain't got yer udder half!" he exclaimed.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        To that, Steve quickly drew his magical glowing stick and thinly
        sliced the farmer. Captain Curt showed up with a loaf of bread, so
        they made sandwiches and fed the cows as well. Then since their
        cover was blown and they still had learned nothing, Captain Curt
        suggested that they find another random farm. Steve had other plans
        though-he wanted to run a carnival show called "The Amazing
        Carnivorous Cows . . . and Steve."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Posh," said Captain Curt, and with that he walked away to find
        another farm to watch for Paul at. Just then, a random English
        teacher showed up and reprimanded Captain Curt for being in a
        sentence that ended with the word "at." Captain Curt then revealed
        to her that in her reprimand, she had committed the very act as for
        which she was reprimanding. Realizing her grammatical sin, she stood
        patiently until her head exploded. Captain Curt brushed her cranial
        slush off his person and finished walking away.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        During all of that, Jay and Kathy had managed to get the flying
        monkey under their control. They began to wonder how they had been
        able to catch a flying monkey, considering the implication in the
        name that such a creature would posses the ability to fly. The
        author then pointed out to them that the flying monkey was never
        specifically portrayed to have means of flight, but merely to bounce
        gaily. Jay and Kathy nodded in revelation, recalling their previous
        giggle from the gaily-bouncing flying monkey.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Wiping the smiles off their faces, yet being careful to leave their
        lips in place so that they would still have them for later, they
        took the flying monkey off to a chemistry lab. Before they even got
        in the door, the monkey spasmed and died. Finding this rather
        confusing, Kathy went to find biology professor who might be able to
        help them study this flying monkey. Jay had a hunch that in finding
        this flying monkey they were probably closer to finding some
        information on whatever it was they were investigating, since Pastor
        Nancy had been chasing it. He took out his TI98 and sent a notice to
        everyone, telling of the flying monkey and what else was going on.
        Kathy came back with the biologist, who after a short time told them
        that the flying monkey had died of unknown causes, and as a side
        note it just so happened that this flying monkey was not a
        carbon-based being, which was odd since all other life was
        carbon-based. Understanding that the next logical question in both
        Jay and Kathy's minds concerned what base the flying monkey might
        have, the biology person told them that it was soy-based.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I knew it!" exclaimed Jay, "There had to be some sort of connection
        between that soy and Paul's evil plan." So it seemed that soy matter
        was being arranged in the form of flying monkeys and then given
        life, which was apparently not too strong a life, since the flying
        monkey had died for no real reason. This made some amount of sense,
        however, since soy had always been lower quality than everything
        else had. The biology person seemed to understand that Jay and Kathy
        were the solution to this soy problem, and so they were given a
        quick lesson on soy percentages on common substances, as well as soy
        tester probe attachments for the TI98s.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        By the time this was completed, they both found themselves quite
        hungry, so they went to get some lunch. After taking the first bite
        of her lunch, Kathy knew something wasn't right: she'd never eaten
        something so completely nasty before. Jay didn't really seem to
        notice-apparently he'd gotten used to it, but since Kathy knew
        something was wrong, she decided to figure out just what it might
        be. She pulled out her soy probe and probed her food. She found its
        soy percentage to be much higher than the biology person taught her
        that it should be. In alarm, Kathy jumped up and screamed in horror
        over the excessive soyness of the food. Jay recognized what was
        going on, so he jumped out of his chair sideways in such a way as to
        land in front of a red glass box. Finding himself quite perplexed
        due to his never having seen red glass before, he stood dumbfounded
        until he noticed the words "in case of emergency, break glass."
        Finding nothing with which to break the glass, he took his blue pen
        out of his pocket, and since it didn't work anyway, jammed it into
        the red glass. Unfortunately, the pen shattered rather than the
        glass, as he had desired. He then turned to the all-powerful
        head-butt, which succeeded in breaking the class, though it also
        resulted in the untimely death of Jay. Then everything became dark
        because someone had painted all the windows black.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Overcoming her previous shock, Kathy ran over and pulled the soy
        alarm. Then she said that she didn't like that Jay had died, but she
        decided that there was little to nothing she could do to change
        that, she would just find someone else. Jay decided that this was
        not something he wanted to happen, so he sat up and proclaimed, "I'm
        not dead yet!" at which point Kathy screeched joyously and ran to
        him. She thought to herself that it was a good thing she had thought
        to think that she would go find someone else because that had worked
        to bring Jay back. She then helped him up and he wiped the blood off
        himself, commenting that it was fortunate the glass was red since
        nobody would have to clean it then, and the last thing he wanted to
        do was make more work for somebody.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Dr. C showed up with his dead cat, saying, "Look, it's a dead cat."
        He seemed quite pleased by this, though Jay was confused as to
        whether Dr. C thought the dead cat was funny or if he was just proud
        of himself for knowing that it was, in fact, a dead cat.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Upon deciding that the last paragraph was terribly insignificant to
        the story, Jay looked out the window and noticed Study Lounge Boy
        walking eastward, which was the way to the buildings where classes
        were held. "Oh look," said Jay, "Study Lounge Boy actually does go
        to class." Kathy looked and saw that it was so, though she could
        find no importance in knowing that, so she said so. Then Jay and
        Kathy were left to sit pondering what might happen as a result of
        pulling the soy alarm.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        After a long time of waiting for something to happen, they decided
        that it was probably a false alarm, so Jay took it off the wall. He
        looked on the back and nearly the entire ScanTron form was marked B,
        which everyone knew by now stood for false. It now appeared as
        though they had stood for a somewhat long time doing nothing for no
        reason. Captain Curt called them quite silly for having done that.
        Just then, Jay dropped his blue pen on himself and became
        erratically upset over the mark it left on his shirt. Before Kathy
        could tell him to calm down, he began pondering over ink. He
        borrowed Kathy 's soy probe (if you will recall, Jay had died
        earlier, and one comes back after death with only the pistol) and
        probed the ink on his chest.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Just as I suspected," he said, "soy." Now they knew that both the
        food and the ink were based on soy, and they knew of a similarly
        based flying monkey as well. So they pooled their thoughts into a
        collective consciousness and surmised together that there existed a
        conspiracy, which had the ultimate purpose of replacing all matter
        with soy. The thoughts were then divided and given back to whomever
        they had come from so that a conversation might take place.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "We've got to do something!" exclaimed Kathy. Jay plunged deep into
        thought over what might be done, while Captain Curt told Kathy about
        Steve 's man-eating cows. At first Captain Curt thought he may have
        been in error by saying that the cows eat people, but then he
        remembered that the first thing they had fed the cows was a farmer,
        so he chose not to say anything lest he appear a fool. This decision
        made sense since there aren't many people who like to look like a
        fool. That left a terribly small probability that Captain Curt was
        one of them, so it was therefore decided that he was not. After all
        of that, they still had no idea what to do about the Soy Conspiracy,
        so they went to see the Amazing Carnivorous Cows . . . and Steve.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Somewhere near Steve and his cows stood Paul, holding a microphone
        and smiling at the video camera that Pastor Nancy was pointing at
        him. "We've secretly switched this man's cows with soy cows,"
        whispered Paul, "let's see if he notices." Now that the conspiracy
        had been uncovered, they were allowed to do this sort of thing
        without worry of being discovered. Steve began his show, ignoring
        the fact that no one had come to see it other than Paul who he
        didn 't even know was there. It seemed as if nobody wanted to pay to
        see cows that eat meat, which Steve simply couldn't understand
        because he thought it was very cool. So he continued to give his
        show to a nonexistent audience. Dr. C told him that making a
        performance when you don't know who the audience is was a terribly
        poor idea, but then Steve said that he was quite aware of the fact
        that he had no audience whatsoever. Dr. C told him that wasn't so
        great an idea either, but he patted Steve on the back for knowing
        who his audience was.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Just then, Jay, Kathy, and Captain Curt showed up. Steve was still
        giving his show to nobody, which the rest of them found terribly
        pathetic, so Captain Curt told him so.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Steve, you are terribly pathetic," said Jay. (Okay, so it was Jay
        who told him and not Captain Curt). At this, Steve became quite
        unhappy, and the show ceased to go on. Kathy started to say that the
        show must go on, but Jay reminded her that the show was horrible, so
        she decided that in this case the show shouldn't go on after all.
        Now that his show was no longer going on, Steve saw that there was
        nothing left to do but once again join the fight against Paul's
        conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Upon the realization that nothing could get accomplished through
        just standing about, Jay decided to probe the cows. It seemed that
        they too had a terribly high soy content, just like everything else.
        From this they realized that soy had already infused into much of
        the world, so it was now too late to prevent it. Instead they had to
        do something else, and though they did not yet know what it was,
        they went off to do it.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Paul, upon remembering that he had been right there the whole time,
        mumbled some nasty things to himself for not having watched. Then he
        noticed Pastor Nancy with the video camera, so he turned to face it
        and said, "Well, if those meddling scientist-types hadn't shown up,
        the soy cows probably would've gone unnoticed." At that point every
        last one of the soy cows fell over dead, but it was okay since the
        camera was no longer recording. Paul realized that the previous
        ordeal would be on the tape. Pastor Nancy told him that they
        probably would not be able to use that as a commercial. Paul said to
        keep it anyway-he would find a use for it, and so off they went,
        looking for that particular use.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        In the place that the other guys were, it had recently been decided
        that Jay should go to the conspiracy and get himself hired as a "soy
        distribution engineer." Captain Curt held the employment section of
        the Sunday paper in the air and read the job description to the
        group.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Applicants must be devious persons comfortable with working closely
        with an evil genius. Marketing abilities a plus. Apply at the
        community farm . . ."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Well, I can pretend to be that person," said Jay. And so it was
        decided, and also so written, and Jay allowed himself to be cast out
        into the world of jobs from the Sunday paper employment section.
        Everyone else realized that there was very little they could do
        while Jay was off working, especially since nobody could remember
        the point of him doing so. This seemed to pose a problem, because if
        Jay didn 't know his purpose in getting the job either, he would have
        to simply sit there with his thumbs tied. It was a bit late for
        minds to be changed, however, since Jay was already being
        interviewed for the job.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Jay ended up getting hired as a soy distribution agent and was
        assigned the task of distributing soy products to a list of places.
        Thinking he remembered the purpose of having this job, Jay found
        real products, which he would distribute instead of the soy
        products, counteracting the job he had been hired for. He realized
        that he had just been involved in a sentence ending in a
        preposition, so he mentioned something about the old Latin-loving
        bastards. Then off he went, taking with him his stock of non-soy
        stuff.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Huddled together back in the lair, the rest of the anti-Pauls
        closely observed Jay through their TI98s. Suddenly, they all
        sprouted long whiskers, bushy tails, and long floppy ears. After
        turning pink, they all began hopping to and fro, proclaiming,
        "We're nutty bunnies," and appearing quite happy about it. Just
        then, by means of a divinely induced intuition, it was realized that
        the story had been going on for quite some time, and rather
        uneventfully at that. The pinkness as well as the other bunny
        features slowly faded as the silliness was slowly allowed to bleed
        from the story. Then the scene switched.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "That'll be all of it, folks," said Jay as he unloaded the last of
        the pseudo-soy. It just so happened that he was at his last delivery
        stop, and was also the only soy distributor.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh crap," complained Paul, "I've been foiled once again." With
        that, he walked away with a slump.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hey wait a minute!" Paul stopped short and expressed a look of
        surprisedness. The voice spoke again: "What are you doing?!? You're
        not even supposed to be in this scene!" Paul carefully searched his
        mind for a valid reason as to why he might be there, but came up
        with very little. A small white cloud rose from his head and visible
        on it was the phrase "Boy I'm evil." Apparently the voice found this
        less than humorous because its hand came down from above to crush
        Paul as well as his small white cloud of thought. And so, the soy
        conspiracy was no more, and there was much rejoicing. (yay)
      </p>
