        The Paul was really mad because The J beat him again, so he decided
        to sue The J for cheating. He talked to the Ooo Ooy, but he wouldn't
        admit that it was impossible to even hurt The J. The J got rid of
        the scars on his arm that were caused by the Paul's pencil, so it
        would be harder for the Paul to prove that The J was indeed
        unhurtable. The Ooo Ooy went to look for The J. It took him about
        1 minute, 12.56 seconds, but he finally found him.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Guess what," said the Ooo Ooy, "the Paul is going to try to sue you
        for being unhurtable."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "You can't sue someone for that!" said The J.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "You can sue someone for just about anything now," said the Ooo Ooy,
        "as long as you can prove that they did it."
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Two weeks later, The Paul got The J to come to court. The J was his
        own lawyer, but the Paul hired a professional (The Steve from a few
        stories ago). The Steve got to go first.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I want to sue The J for being unhurtable."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Your honor, I object," said The J.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay," said the judge (The Ooo Ooy), "Steve, you cannot do that.
        This case is over. The J wins, and gets $100 from The Paul for
        having to come."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Everyone left. The Paul was not happy that The J won the case, so he
        decided to prove The J guilty by himself.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        That night, the Paul broke in to The J's house. He had a Polaroid
        camera to get his evidence. He searched The J's desk, but all he
        found was letters from the Jessi, who hasn't been mentioned yet.
        This made the Paul angry, so he took the letters and went to the
        Steve for help once again.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Steve!" yelled the Paul as he burst into the Steve's house.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What now?" asked the Steve.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Look what I found," said the Paul.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The Steve looked at the letters. "So," he asked, "what's the big
        deal?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Can't we use these like they would use it in an election?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "You mean make commercials on TV, radio, and newspapers that tells
        about it?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Yeah. Can you do it?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Sure but It'll cost you $2,000."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I can get it from my pocket money mint," said the Paul, "see?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That's illegal, Paul," said the Steve.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I know."
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Meanwhile, at The J's house, The J was talking to the Ooo Ooy. "I
        don't believe you, Ooo Ooy."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "But it's true," said the Ooo Ooy, "I heard them on the brain wave
        frequency on your nifty high-tech radio you made last week. It's a
        good thing I was the judge of that case or they might have found out
        that you're unhurtable because of that awesome elixir you invented."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That would have been a disaster. Everyone would have to have some.
        I don't feel like making that much of it or even giving out the
        formula."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "We've got to stop them from making those commercials."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay. I'll tell Jessi. She'll help us stop them."
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        The next day, The J and the Ooo Ooy went to the Jessi's house. The
        Jessi for some reason was waiting for them. This was strange to The
        J, because he hadn't told her that he and the Ooo Ooy were coming.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Don't just stand there like an idiot, come in here!" said the
        Jessi. They went inside and the Ooo Ooy told the Jessi what the Paul
        and the Steve were going to do.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Here, drink this," said The J. He handed her a blue, bubbling
        liquid, "I call it the elixir of invincibility."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What's it do?" she asked. The Ooo Ooy left to go back to where he
        and The J lived and the Jessi drank the elixir. "It tastes good but
        what's it for?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Exactly what it says," responded The J.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I still don't understand it," said the Jessi.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "You will," said The J. They left to go stop the Steve and the Paul.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        When they arrived, the Jessi asked, "What are we going to do to
        them?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "We could start by getting back the letters," said The J, "and then
        maybe we could cancel all their ads."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay," said the Jessi, "you cancel the ads, I'll get the letters."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The Jessi was looking for the letters when the Steve came home.
        "WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?" yelled the Steve. He picked up his
        pencil and stabbed her in the arm (he missed her heart). She was not
        hurt, but she healed the wound anyway. "You can't do that!" said the
        Steve, "It's not fair!"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Sure I can," said the Jessi, "thanks to The J. Ah, here they are."
        She picked up the letters and left.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Back at The J's and the Ooo Ooy's house, The J was showing the Jessi
        how he had made the elixir. He mixed grape juice and pineapple juice
        and banana juice and water together in a pot and boiled it on the
        stove. While it was still bubbling, he put it in the freezer.
        After it was frozen, he took it out and let it melt. He then put it
        in his refrigerator.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "It only lasts a year after you drink it, but it never spoils, so I
        can make this pitcher and keep it until we need more," said The J.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That's nice," said the Jessi, not sounding interested, but who
        would?
      </p>
