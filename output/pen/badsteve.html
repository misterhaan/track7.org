        This is a summary.&nbsp; I repeat:&nbsp; This is only a
        summary.&nbsp; Had this been an actual story, it would probably have
        more than one paragraph.&nbsp; Paul got into some kind of
        championship fight with Steve.&nbsp; Steve put up a good fight, but
        Paul had an 0.5mm pencil instead of the regular wooden variety.&nbsp;
        In the end Steve was killed.&nbsp; That's the way pencil fights had
        to end.&nbsp; It was written in the rules somewhere.&nbsp; That is
        about everything important.
