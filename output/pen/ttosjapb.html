        Once upon a time there traveled the Kingdom of Bargondais a much esteemed
        knight by the name of Sir Jay.&nbsp; Wherever this knight was or had
        been, people adored him, while tales praising his valor and honor reached
        even those lands which his eyes had never seen.&nbsp; His sword was said
        to weigh nearly as much as he did (without his armor), and he carried no
        shield nor rode he a steed.&nbsp; He trusted his sword to protect him and
        his feet to transport him.&nbsp; Though the stories told of him generally
        left this out, rather than wear heavy plate armor which weighs more than
        enough to make walking difficult and a horse a necessity, he wore a mail
        shirt, a pair of gloves, and a light helmet, so that he could move more
        quickly.
      </p>

      <p class="indent">
        As the sun was setting one night, Sir Jay was moving somewhat quickly
        toward the town of Dristan so that he might find some rest after
        defeating the evil Lord Rangolar who had gone against the good King and
        attempted to mobilize the Land of Magdon to make war and put himself upon
        the throne.&nbsp; Sir Jay had reached the Land of Magdon long before any
        other of the good King's Knights and had begun the battle against the
        evil Lord Rangolar alone, which was no small feat seeing that Rangolar
        already had much of the Magdonians equipped for battle and had planned on
        moving Northward once he had a few more men.&nbsp; Once more of the good
        King's Knights arrived, Sir Jay had already made significant progress
        against Lord Rangolar and led the other knights to a quick victory.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        Sir Jay entered the town of Dristan alone, as the rest of the good King's
        Knights had (as they always did) started riding back toward the Castle
        Bargon.&nbsp; It may seem that Sir Jay would go with them, but as
        mentioned earlier, he was without horse.&nbsp; Also Sir Jay had not been
        to the Castle Bargon in many years, which while he was unaware caused his
        fame there to increase:&nbsp; the people of the Good King's Village
        thought Sir Jay to be invincible.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        The people of Dristan, though never having been visited by Sir Jay, had
        heard of him and were quick to welcome him to their town.&nbsp; They
        wanted so badly to hear of his most recent adventure that he felt selfish
        when he asked that he might be granted a meal and then a bed where he may
        lie uninterrupted for a short while.&nbsp; Though knights in the Kingdom
        of Bargondais were very well cared for in the Castle Bargon, a knight
        away from the Castle must either provide for himself in the wilderness or
        depend on the gratitude of the very people he protected, which for a
        knight such as Sir Jay was quite abundant.&nbsp; They offered to have a
        town Feast in his honor, but Sir Jay graciously declined, saying that a
        simple meal should suit him quite well.&nbsp; The people reluctantly
        agreed, and he was granted his simple meal and then shown to a bed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        It had not been many hours since Sir Jay had lay down when a very excited
        small boy awoke him, gave a bow, and informed him that there was someone
        outside who wished to see him.&nbsp; The boy did not specify who exactly
        it was waiting for him outside, but Sir Jay certainly did not view his
        rest as more important than the request of a townsperson to see
        him--after all, it was the townspeople who had filled his stomach and
        granted him a place to rest his head.&nbsp; Sir Jay kindly told the boy
        that he need not bow before him (to which the boy seemed to take slight
        offense though he mentioned nothing of it), then dressed himself and
        asked to be brought to his caller.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        A few minutes later, Sir Jay stepped outside behind the boy and saw the
        good King himself (surrounded by a sizeable court, as would be expected)
        smiling at him.&nbsp; Sir Jay quickly lowered his eyes and asked to what
        honor he might owe such a visit.&nbsp; The good King then asked if he was
        not the good King's knight Sir Jay, to which Sir Jay said that he was,
        and the good King replied that indeed, the honor fell upon him.&nbsp; He
        went on to explain that he had heard of Sir Jay's most recent victory and
        thought that something should be done about it:&nbsp; specifically, he
        offered to bring Sir Jay to the Castle Bargon where he would be
        proclaimed Head Knight, after which a parade would be held in his
        honor.&nbsp; To any other of the good King's Knights, such an offer from
        the good King himself would have most certainly been an opportunity to
        accept, but Sir Jay instead replied that he felt unworthy of such an
        honor, yet he would certainly go along with his sire's wishes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        When it was time for the ceremonial feast, Sir Jay entered the banquet
        hall of the Castle Bargon where an attendant quickly came to his side to
        lead him to his seat.&nbsp; But before even did he notice the attendant
        at his side his eyes fell upon the most gorgeous creature he had ever
        seen.&nbsp; His mind swiftly collected all available information
        concerning her appearance so that he could follow the attendant to his
        seat without staring at her.&nbsp; The seat he was shown to was next to
        the good King, and seated on the good King's other side was the vision of
        beauty Sir Jay had noticed not long before.&nbsp; The good King welcomed
        him and introduced the young woman as his daughter, the fair Princess
        Brittany.&nbsp; This revelation caused the heart of Sir Jay to sink
        considerably--surely a princess would want nothing to do with such a
        rogue as himself, and even if existed her some form of interest in the
        knightly profession, surely she could find a knight much greater than he,
        one who deserved the honors which that very day would be extended to Sir
        Jay.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        Sir Jay quickly masked his disappointment so that the good King might not
        feel as if Sir Jay was in fact disappointed with the feast prepared in
        his honor, and besides, he was quite certain that the beautiful Princess
        Brittany had not but noticed him anyway.&nbsp; As the banquet progressed,
        the accomplishments of Sir Jay as a knight were repeatedly praised, but
        his thoughts were too focused on the fair Princess Brittany to allow his
        mind time to silently protest the barrage of undeserved compliments.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        At the end of the meal, the good King asked for the sword of Sir Jay,
        which he handed to an attendant who handed back to his King a slightly
        larger sword adorned with honorable gems and metals.&nbsp; The good King,
        using the new sword, declared Sir Jay Head Knight.&nbsp; Once the sword
        was handed to Sir Jay (who held it out so that those present had the
        opportunity to gaze upon the glory and wealth inherent in the Kingdom of
        Bargondais before he introduced it to its sheath), the people cheered
        enthusiastically, as they too were pleased with the good King's decision
        to name Sir Jay Head Knight.&nbsp; Sir Jay then shook congratulatory
        hands of many of the good King's men, and was quite pleased as well as
        surprised by a polite kiss from the beautiful Princess Brittany.
      </p>

      <p class="indent">
        The Good King's Village held what they believed to be the privilege of
        housing Sire Jay for but one more night before he was once again on his
        feet roaming the Kingdom of Bargondais, protecting its King and its
        people.&nbsp; At times he received a letter from the fair Princess
        Brittany, which never failed to cheer him greatly, and he sent letters
        back whenever he had the time.&nbsp; After being named Head Knight, Sir
        Jay was known throughout the Kingdom, which left little difficulty for
        couriers aiding in his correspondence with the beautiful Princess
        Brittany.&nbsp; With time, however, this correspondence dwindled, and the
        thoughts of Sir Jay (though he never actually forgot her) turned more
        toward his duties as Head Knight.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        Over the years, the rest of the good King's Knights began to favor
        surrounding Sir Jay with themselves, as his role of Head Knight declared
        him their leader.&nbsp; Many of them previous to his naming to Head
        Knight had heard as well as told stories of his knightly greatness, and
        after serving under him found the stories more true than they had
        expected.&nbsp; Yet still Sir Jay could not see himself as others saw
        him.&nbsp; In fact, during a particularly bloody battle in which Sir Jay
        was in command of nearly every one of the good King's Knights, his view
        of himself reached what very well may have been its lowest point.&nbsp;
        Being accustomed to battles in which the valiance of the good King's
        Knights was presented in all its ferocity, battles in which the
        opposition wasted no time in backing down from the impressive knightly
        force, the good King's Knights began to doubt Sir Jay's leadership when
        this battle lasted more than a few weeks.&nbsp; Some of them even went so
        far as to break themselves from his leadership, and this blow to unity
        resulted in the loss of a large number of Knights.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Oddly enough, at the very point in time when he needed it more than ever
        before, Sir Jay once again received a letter from the beautiful Princess
        Brittany.&nbsp; Through continued correspondence he shared with her the
        events which continued to plague his mind and noticed that she cared
        about him, which pleased him greatly.&nbsp; Despite this spirit-lifter,
        Sir Jay and the remainder of the good King's Knights still faced great
        loss in their eventual defeat of the hostile band of invaders.
      </p>

      <p class="indent">
        Sir Jay had barely arrived in the nearest town when he was informed that
        his presence had been requested in the Castle Bargon by the good King
        Himself once again.&nbsp; Despite the heaviness in his heart, Sir Jay
        allowed himself to rest a short while, but set off immediately afterward
        for the Castle Bargon.&nbsp; He tried to lighten his heart by pointing
        out to himself that a trip to the Castle Bargon most likely included an
        opportunity to speak to the fair Princess Brittany.&nbsp; This was
        however somewhat difficult considering that Sir Jay could find no other
        rationalization for the good King's request other than to reprimand him
        for taking so tremendous a loss in the most recent battle, and though he
        felt he deserved such a dishonor, his feeling that he was terribly
        unworthy of being in the company of the good King seemed to dominate.
      </p>

      <p class="indent">
        It was not until a number of weeks had passed that the beautiful Princess
        Brittany discovered Sir Jay amongst the trees of a forest near the Good
        King's Village.&nbsp; Sir Jay had not recognized her in time to avoid
        being seen because she was still wearing the hooded cloak that she often
        wore when walking through the village with no intention of being
        recognized.&nbsp; Sir Jay bowed as the fair Princess Brittany approached
        him.&nbsp; It was not long before she asked why he had not come to the
        Castle Bargon, and he explained to her his feelings of failure as Head
        Knight, how outside knighthood he had nothing, and once he could not
        serve the good King as a knight, he had nothing.&nbsp; The beautiful
        Princess Brittany had listened both intently as well as caringly while
        Sir Jay had explained his view of his situation to her, but now that it
        was beginning to get dark, she told him that she must return to the
        Castle Bargon, and that she wished for him to come as well and speak with
        the good King.&nbsp; Sir Jay of course was not especially akin to this
        suggestion, but once he declined she offered to return the next morning
        so that the two of them could discuss the situation further, which he
        graciously accepted.&nbsp; He watched as her elegant outline faded into
        the distant trees and the thought of seeing her again the next day easily
        overwhelmed any reluctancy he may have otherwise felt due to her desire
        for him to see the good King.&nbsp; He slept much better that evening
        than he had for a very great deal of time.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        Early the next morning Sir Jay noticed the fair Princess Brittany,
        shrouded in her cloak, making her way through the trees toward him.&nbsp;
        He watched her slip the hood of her cloak off her head and thought surely
        her beauty had increased since he last gazed upon her.&nbsp; They sat
        down together beneath a large oak tree, and though Sir Jay sat in the
        shade, the morning sun shone through the leaves to accent the beautiful
        Princess Brittany with a warm glow that Sir Jay found especially
        comforting.&nbsp; She then began her argument to Sir Jay that he should
        in fact go with her to the Castle Bargon that day.&nbsp; She explained
        that the good King was not at all upset with Sir Jay, nor had He any
        desire to disgrace him.&nbsp; Instead, she explained, the good King
        wished to extend to Sir Jay an invitation to the Castle Bargon, not for
        the purpose of meeting, but instead to stay as a guest.&nbsp; Of course
        the good King had met difficulty until then in reaching Sir Jay with this
        new invitation.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        When Sir Jay showed that he still held back from the acceptance of such
        an invitation, the fair Princess Brittany offered to personally escort
        him to the good King.&nbsp; To Sir Jay, any idea involving the company of
        the beautiful Princess Brittany held considerably more appeal than did
        the same idea save her presence, yet he was not especially certain that
        to allow the fair Princess Brittany evidence of his interest in her was a
        safe action.&nbsp; He did although feel that everything that had ever
        been important to him had already been lost, and so, seeing that little
        remained anyway, he finally accepted the beautiful Princess Brittany's
        offer.&nbsp; She then waited while he somewhat reluctantly donned his
        uniform once again, then much less reluctantly offered his arm to the
        fair Princess Brittany as they started toward the Castle Bargon.
      </p>

      <p class="indent">
        Since the beautiful Princess Brittany had decided not to raise the hood
        of her cloak, the people of the Good King's Village recognized her face
        as well as the sword carried by Sir Jay (most of them had seen it when it
        was given to him).&nbsp; For the most part, the people remained silent as
        was expected of them in such a situation, though a few murmurs concerning
        the significance of Sir Jay walking through the village with the fair
        Princess Brittany found their way into the air.&nbsp; They both had
        expected that the people would speak of seeing Sir Jay once again, as
        well as more specifically with whom they had seen him.
      </p>

      <p class="story">
        Upon their arrival at the Castle Bargon, the beautiful Princess Brittany
        brought Sir Jay to the good King.&nbsp; The first thing the good King
        wished to know was why it had taken so long for Sir Jay to come to Him,
        and so Sir Jay explained his reasons for not wishing to speak to the good
        King.&nbsp; Once his explanation was finished, the good King told him
        that truly, he had not failed in his servitude as a knight until he chose
        not to come speak with the good King.&nbsp; He then went on to explain
        that while Sir Jay would not be stripped of his title of Head Knight, the
        good King no longer wished for Sir Jay to serve Him as he had in the
        past--the good King had a different idea for him, but would not reveal it
        just yet.&nbsp; For now Sir Jay was to remain as a guest of the court of
        the good King, which Sir Jay accepted despite his not wishing to wait
        because he desired to serve his King in whichever way the good King
        desired.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        After dinner that evening, the fair Princess Brittany took Sir Jay by the
        arm and they walked together out to the castle garden to sit together,
        watch the sun set, and wait for the stars to come out.&nbsp; At times
        while they sat in silent observance, Sir Jay noticed much to his
        enjoyment that the beautiful Princess Brittany would rest her head upon
        his shoulder.&nbsp; Upon her viewing of the evening's first star, the
        fair Princess Brittany commented to Sir Jay on the elegant beauty of the
        night sky.&nbsp; He turned to look at her and thought to himself that her
        elegance and beauty were much more impressive than that of the sky.&nbsp;
        He did not notice until she turned to look at him that he was still
        looking at her--he had forgotten to turn back to the sky because he found
        her much more captivating.&nbsp; But now that she had seen him looking at
        her there was really no need to turn back to the sky, and thus the focus
        of his attention narrowed to her soft lips which he noticed glistened
        with just the right amount of starlight.&nbsp; He thought of how
        incredibly wonderful it must feel to have those lips pressed against his
        . . . he placed his hand gently aside her jaw . . . he guided her face
        toward his own . . . he tilted his head so that their lips would better
        match up . . . he found that the sensation of her lips pressed against
        his was much more incredible than he had expected.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The realization that he had actually acted upon his desires startled Sir
        Jay, but before there was a chance for a reaction on his part, he felt
        upon the back of his neck the touch of a slightly cool hand, and against
        his lips once again the pressure of warm lips.&nbsp; There was no
        interpretation other than the object of his affection was returning his
        gesture of romantic interest.&nbsp; Though these events had stirred up
        more than enough thoughts in his mind to allow him to discuss them all
        through the night, he felt it more fitting to silently enjoy what
        remained of nightfall as well as the company of the one he found so
        completely amazing.&nbsp; He put an arm around her and gently pulled her
        close to him due both to the slowly falling temperature as well as his
        desire to simply be closer to her.&nbsp; There was of course no reason
        obvious to either of them as to why they should not kiss again, and so
        while they continued to enjoy the company of one another as more stars
        revealed themselves, their eyes and lips more than once followed a
        pattern similar to that which they had done shortly before.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Sir Jay woke the next morning with a lightheartedness he had never before
        experienced, and he knew full well that his escapade the previous evening
        with the beautiful Princess Brittany was solely responsible.&nbsp; His
        spirits dropped slightly, however, when he remembered that the fair
        Princess Brittany had left that morning to speak with a nearby kingdom
        and would not return for four days.&nbsp; He spent practically all of the
        time while she was away in the library (which he thought had the best
        chance of accelerating his thought processes) thinking about her, and the
        possibility of the two of them together.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        He felt for the first time that someone truly cared for him, and while
        the idea of depending at all upon the care of another somewhat frightened
        him, it was at the same time comforting to know that she did care.&nbsp;
        The beautiful Princess Brittany must also have noticed that he had more
        reason than appreciating a listening ear for enjoying her company, he
        decided, certainly now if not before they had kissed.&nbsp; The idea of
        kissing brought his thoughts back to the feast at which he had been named
        Head Knight, but more specifically the polite kiss he had received from
        the fair Princess Brittany at its close.&nbsp; He saw now though it had
        been hidden from him before that the kiss had meant much more to him than
        he had realized.&nbsp; Even then he had loved her, though he was just now
        putting it all together.&nbsp; The feeling he had every time he heard
        from her suddenly could be understood; explained by his love for her.&nbsp;
        The fact that he had come to see the good King while remaining
        unconvinced that the good King did not wish to reprimand him in some way
        could now be rationalized--the beautiful Princess Brittany had wished it,
        and so it was.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        He also began to believe that she also felt for him something akin to
        what he felt for her.&nbsp; She could easily have brought a search party
        into the forest once she knew Sir Jay was there and forced him to come to
        the Castle Bargon, but she instead chose to leave the decision to him and
        simply let him know how she felt about the situation.&nbsp; She wrote of
        how greatly she appreciated receiving the letters which Sir Jay wrote to
        her despite the fact that his world at the time was almost entirely the
        world of a knight--he wrote mostly of battles and life on the road.&nbsp;
        Most unmistakably, she had returned his kiss.
      </p>

      <p class="indent">
        By the time he had sorted all of this out in his mind, the four days had
        passed, and he felt he had much to talk with her about, so he called
        her.&nbsp; She agreed to come see him and it was not long before they
        were sitting together discussing the events of the evening slightly less
        than a week ago.&nbsp; He knew that within a couple more days he would
        have to leave once again, and they both knew that she had to stay.&nbsp;
        This inevitable physical separation combined with their expectations that
        others might find fault in their being together caused them to arrive at
        the decision that it would be best for both of them to not let the
        evening of their kisses advance their relationship at the time.
      </p>

      <p class="indent">
        After he left they remained in close contact (or as close as two people
        can manage without the convenience of actually seeing each other) and it
        was not long before their love for one another overpowered their decision
        not to come together.&nbsp; A few more weeks and he was driving back to
        see her and take her to a dance--his fantasy world had slowly faded now
        that the real world had become better and more interesting . . .
