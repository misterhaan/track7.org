      <p class="story">
        Sir Jay walked into his top secret lab with the freezer (he also
        had a secret lab without the freezer). "How's it coming?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Just finishing up Captain Curt right now," said Sergeant Jess. Sir
        Jay walked over to a computer screen and made sure that the two
        serial killers that were after him were still far away. A short
        while after that, Sergeant Jess finished with Captain Curt. She had
        been using Sir Jay's cloning techniques to bring back all the
        people that Pastor Nancy had torn apart. They now had all the
        people of the M&amp;M's galaxy in Sir Jay's lab. I know they
        couldn't have possibly all fit, but don't worry about that right
        now. Sir Jay led them to a room full of spaceships so they could
        all go home. He and Sergeant Jess got on the <i>Happyfries</i> with
        Captain Curt who had agreed to help them.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        They headed for Pastor Nancy and Doctor Erin's ship at really fast
        speed. They were going to solve this problem once and for all. Sir
        Jay had made a few modifications on the <i>Happyfries</i> to make
        this mission easier. When they were about halfway there, Sir Jay
        said, "Wait a minute, where's Miss Molly?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Never mind that right now," said the wall, "just worry about
        getting those killers."
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Captain Curt realized they were there and he stopped the
        <i>Happyfries</i>. Everyone flew forward from the sudden stop. A
        compartment popped open and Miss Molly fell out.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Why were you in there?" asked Sir Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I wanted to come with you guys but I didn't think you'd let me."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "We would have let you," said Captain Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "You must feel stupid," said Sir Jay. They tried to talk to Pastor
        Nancy and Doctor Erin's ship, but an ugly face they'd never seen
        before came up instead. "Who is that?" asked Sir Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That's Stupid Robbie," said Captain Curt. He pressed a couple of
        fake buttons. "Scotty, beam him aboard." A board appeared in Stupid
        Robbie's hand. "No, no, no. Beam him over here." Stupid Robbie
        appeared with the board.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Watch this," said Sir Jay. He pressed lots of buttons that were
        actually real and then he pressed the big red one marked "fire."
        Stupid Robbie burst into flames. Miss Molly found a convenient fire
        extinguisher and sprayed him with it. Then she took him to see the
        ship's doctor. Sir Jay pressed the correct button and two little
        snowball things flew at the other ship and it blew up.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That's nifty," said Captain Curt. Sir Jay pressed some more
        buttons and a cane appeared in Captain Curt's hand. His shoes
        turned into tap shoes and a top hat appeared on his head. He
        started dancing around singing "Hello my Baby."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Cut that out," said Sergeant Jess, "we're on an important mission
        here." Sir Jay pressed a few more buttons and Captain Curt went
        back to normal (for him anyway). Then they went into really fast
        speed towards the ship they were really looking for.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        When they stopped again, Stupid Robbie got smashed into the wall.
        "We're in orbit around their ship," said somebody who was sitting
        at the navigational controls.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "You idiot," said Captain Curt, "we orbit planets, not ships. For
        ships we just sit there."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The person at the navigational controls pressed buttons that
        beeped, and it looked like he was playing Simon. "Just sitting
        there, sir." They tried to talk to Pastor Nancy, but were hit by a
        flashlight beam instead. "We've lost really fast speed
        capabilities," said somebody. Sir Jay pressed a couple of buttons
        and a snowball thing flew at the ship. "The enemy ship has lost
        power," said that guy again, "Good shot, sir." Sir Jay took
        Sergeant Jess by the arm and brought her down to the beam machine
        room.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Scotty," said Sir Jay, "beam everyone from that ship over here."
        Scotty started hitting the necessary buttons while Sergeant Jess
        got out her army issue really big gun and Sir Jay got out his
        magical glowing stick and switched it on. By the time Pastor Nancy
        and Doctor Erin were there, The really big gun was already aimed at
        them and Sir Jay was ready with his magical glowing stick. They
        took the two serial killers and locked them in the bad guys' room.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        By the time Pastor Nancy realized they were locked up, the ship's
        really fast speed capabilities had been found again. Somebody had
        put it in a little cabinet and forgot where it was. Pastor Nancy
        knocked on the walls all the way around the room to see if it
        sounded hollow anywhere. She smashed the mirror and they both
        climbed into the long narrow passage behind it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Great, a dead end," said Doctor Erin.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Shh!" whispered Pastor Nancy. She looked through the two-way
        mirror that Doctor Erin thought was a dead end. Sir Jay, Sergeant
        Jess, Miss Molly, and Stupid Robbie were in the guest room. Pastor
        Nancy and Doctor Erin backed up so they could run and jump through
        the mirror because they thought it would look cool.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Ha!" said Doctor Erin for no particular reason. Sir Jay rolled a
        small gas capsule over to where the two serial killers were
        standing. The rest of them put their hands in the air. The gas
        capsule released its gas, causing the serial killers to be
        temporarily distracted by the awful smell. Sir Jay and the others
        held their noses and ran past them into the passage.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Somewhere between the two rooms, Sir Jay jumped up and caught hold
        of a ladder. The others followed him and they heard Pastor Nancy
        jump into the passage. On their way up the ladder, Sir Jay pressed
        a button on the end of his sleeve and said, "Captain Curt to deck
        23." Sir Jay jumped backwards off the ladder and they ran down the
        passage. They stopped at the end and Miss Molly pressed a button
        that made the mirror swing out so they didn't have to break it and
        have bad luck.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What's going on here?" asked Captain Curt as he walked in the
        door. Pastor Nancy and Doctor Erin came out of the passage. Sir Jay
        got out his magical glowing stick and forgetting something
        important, swung it in a circle, creating a life saver. Pastor
        Nancy picked it up and threw it at him. Sir Jay ducked. The life
        saver hit a button on one of the computer things. The screen showed
        the message: self-destruct initiated. Even though the ship was
        going to blow up, Pastor Nancy really wanted Sir Jay out of her
        way. She got her magical glowing stick out (hers was red) and
        started fighting Sir Jay. Captain Curt was at the computer trying
        to stop the self-destruct from self-destructing. Miss Molly got the
        rest of them into a corner where they'd be out of the way of the
        fighters. Stupid Robbie ran in circles around the room.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "We're going to die!" he shouted over and over. Captain Curt (who
        was having no success in shutting down the self-destruct) got hit
        by Stupid Robbie and was thrown into the corner with the others.
        Sir Jay looked over there and Stupid Robbie continued to run around
        the room. Pastor Nancy swung at him and he turned around just in
        time to block it. He flew into the corner and hit a button. A door
        closed him and the other three in and the escape capsule that they
        had thought was merely a corner was launched from the ship. The
        ship exploded as Sir Jay and Captain Curt watched through the
        escape capsule's window. It would have been really loud if sound
        could travel through empty space.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "My ship!" cried Captain Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Don't worry," said Sir Jay, "it was only a copy. I have three more
        of them anyway."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Looks like we're finally rid of those two," said Sergeant Jess.
        Sir Jay wasn't so sure.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        It was a long and cramped ride back to Sir Jay's top secret lab
        with the freezer. After going through 99 bottles of beer on the
        wall three times, they realized that that song gets quite annoying
        after a while. They started singing 98 bottles of beer on the wall
        instead. They only made it halfway through that one when they
        smacked into the surface of the planet with Sir Jay's secret lab
        with the freezer. They all got out and stuffed themselves into the
        phone booth that was sitting there. Sir Jay dialed 1-2-3 and the
        whole phone booth shot downward into the planet. It stopped when it
        got to the lab.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay," said Sir Jay as he walked over to one of the computer
        displays and pressed a lot of buttons (they were all real, too).
        The word "locating" popped up onto the screen. Then a map of the
        solar system they were in popped up. Sir Jay looked for the little
        red dot. "Aha!" he said when he found it. "They'll be impacting the
        surface in about a minute." He walked over to the phone booth and
        taped a sign to it that said "dial 1-2-3 for operator." Then he
        picked up the phone next to the booth and dialed 3-2-1. The empty
        booth shot upwards to the surface. Captain Curt didn't like this
        idea much because he didn't want to have his head ripped off again.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Hey!" shouted Doctor Erin, "Wake up, we're going to hit that
        planet!" They hit the planet with a whack. When they decided it was
        safe to get out of their capsule, Pastor Nancy noticed the other
        escape capsule. After they had made sure there was nobody in the
        other capsule, they walked over to the phone booth.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Dial 1-2-3 for operator," said the sign. They got inside the booth
        and Doctor Erin dialed 1-2-3. The phone booth shot downwards into
        the planet once again. When they got out at the lab, they noticed a
        long table with a very large chocolate cake on it. For a reason
        they never did figure out, they both felt compelled to eat all of
        it, so they did.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Further back in the lab, Sir Jay and Captain Curt were working on
        their plan. Stupid Robbie was watching. He wouldn't have been
        there, but he was too stupid to figure out that he died on the copy
        of the <i>Happyfries</i> when it blew up.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Don't touch that!" But Sir Jay was too late. Captain Curt had
        already pressed the button marked "fry" and ordered a medium fries
        which shot down from the ceiling into an indentation on the table
        in front of him. He had expected Stupid Robbie to get fried like
        when Sir Jay pressed the fire button, but obviously that's not the
        way this button worked. Sir Jay made Captain Curt share the fries
        with him.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Oh," groaned Doctor Erin who had eaten approximately five cubic
        feet of chocolate cake.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Yeah," agreed Pastor Nancy who had eaten approximately twenty
        cubic feet of chocolate cake. Sir Jay had set up this table full of
        chocolate cake and had his computer play a song that was found to
        have a mind-controlling influence on most people. It was a song by
        Nirvana with lyrics modified by Camp Michigamme kitchen staff to
        say "I love chocolate cake, I love chocolate cake..."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The two serial killers were now quite large. There had been a
        theory proposed a while back that if one was to consume a large
        enough mass of food in a short enough time, that one would generate
        a strong enough gravity to be able to attract small objects. Sir
        Jay thought that if two were to consume a large enough mass of food
        in a short enough time, those two would generate strong enough
        gravities to attract one another.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        They started walking down the hallway and Pastor Nancy tripped and
        fell on Doctor Erin. Doctor Erin let out a grunt. When they got up,
        they found that they were being held together by a strange unseen
        force. They decided to ignore it and continue down the hallway.
        They couldn't move very fast being so large, and being stuck
        together didn't help much either.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "What do you mean you lost it?" screamed Sir Jay, "It's a hole! How
        could you lose a hole?" Stupid Robbie looked at his feet. Sir Jay
        heard people coming and forgot about yelling at Stupid Robbie.
        Pastor Nancy and Doctor Erin reached the doorway; still held
        together by their own gravities. Sir Jay pushed Stupid Robbie at
        them and led the others down a different hallway. Pastor Nancy
        hadn't ripped off any heads lately, so she took this opportunity to
        end Stupid Robbie's life for the second time. She then pursued the
        others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Sir Jay got to the place where he kept all the ships when his
        freezer was full and got into one of the copies of the
        <i>Happyfries</i>. Sergeant Jess followed him while Captain Curt
        and Miss Molly got into a different one. They took off and the two
        villains got onto a different ship that was not a copy of the
        <i>Happyfries</i>. Somebody must have forgotten to take their ship
        home. The two <i>Happyfries</i> copies went into really fast speed.
        Sir Jay put his copy on "autopilot--follow lead of
        <i>Happyfries</i> #4" mode and took Sergeant Jess with him to build
        another one of what Stupid Robbie had lost. This was how Sir Jay
        planned to finally conquer the evils that were Pastor Nancy and her
        accomplice.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Captain Curt was having his copy of the <i>Happyfries</i> figure
        out how long it would take for the bad guys to catch up to them at
        all kinds of distances from the planet. Sir Jay used the
        communication thing to tell Captain Curt that he needed twenty
        minutes to finish the device that would serve as the final
        imprisonment of the two psychopathic serial killers. No, Nancy, I
        won't tell you what it is yet. Captain Curt's ship hadn't come up
        with the right distance to give Sir Jay the right amount of time,
        so he just guessed. The two copies of the <i>Happyfries</i> stopped
        and Captain Curt and Miss Molly beamed over to Sir Jay's copy. They
        hid behind a conveniently located asteroid because Captain Curt had
        guessed wrong and Sir Jay needed more time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "We're almost there," said Doctor Erin.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay," said Pastor Nancy who was still being held to Doctor Erin
        by something neither of them could ever hope to understand, "take
        us out of sort of fast speed." They saw the <i>Happyfries</i> in
        front of them and tried to talk to them. There was no response.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Darn," said Doctor Erin who had wanted to say a nifty bad guy
        "I've got you now" type phrase. After many shots with their wimpy
        little flashlight beam, the <i>Happyfries</i> blew up. They
        realized that it had not made any attempt to defend against them.
        They had no idea why until they remembered that there were two
        <i>Happyfries</i> out there.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "They've found us," said Captain Curt, "You ready with that thing?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Not quite," said Sir Jay, "Try to stall them."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The face of Pastor Nancy appeared on the viewscreen. "Prepare to be
        boarded." Pastor Nancy and Doctor Erin beamed onto the
        <i>Happyfries</i> with two by fours that they began hitting
        everyone with. Captain Curt ducked under a swinging board that hit
        the guy at the controls. He was knocked unconscious on the controls
        that started flashing "Teacup and saucer separation."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Captain Curt pressed a button marked "pause" and ran down to the
        room where Sir Jay was working on the holding device for Pastor
        Nancy. Two black ninjas jumped down from the ceiling and hit him a
        few times and then blindfolded him. Captain Curt staggered in to
        the room. Sir Jay noticed that it was Captain Curt and told him to
        hold still. Captain Curt realized that the pause button didn't work
        from room to room.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Good job stalling for time," said Sir Jay, "I'm almost done now.
        The black ninjas will remove your blindfold when you leave."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "The separation sequence was activated, brace yourself for it."
        Captain Curt started walking toward the nearest wall.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "No, over here," whispered one of the black ninjas. Captain Curt
        turned and walked back to the doorway. The black ninjas jumped down
        and hit him a few times before removing the blindfold. He walked
        back to where he was before and pressed the pause button again.
        Everyone started moving again. Captain Curt ducked under something
        and waited while Pastor Nancy and Doctor Erin continued "boarding"
        his crew. He pressed a button next to him and told Sir Jay the
        separation was about to happen. The video camera shook and everyone
        fell in different directions. Captain Curt sprung from his hiding
        place and grabbed the two boards and ran down the hall.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Ha ha, you can't catch me!" That did it. There was no way that
        evil people could ignore a challenge like that. They began chasing
        him down the hall to the room where Sir Jay had his trap ready. The
        black ninjas jumped down from the doorway and hit and blindfolded
        Captain Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Sir Jay looked up from the other side of the room. "Uh-oh," he said
        to himself so the people watching this on video could tell what was
        happening, "Captain Curt's going to fall into the trap for Pastor
        Nancy and Doctor Erin! What can I do?" He heard a big rip back on
        the other side of the room and two guys fell on the floor. They
        picked up Captain Curt and pressed buttons on their shoes that
        rocketed them back up where they had come from. "Huh?" By then the
        two villains, who were on their way to becoming only one villain,
        had been hit and blindfolded. They were staggering towards the
        device Sir Jay had built for them. Pastor Nancy let out a shriek as
        they fell into it. It was a pit filled with foam cubes. Sir Jay had
        done some studies on Pastor Nancy's physical capabilities (hey, he
        did used to be Professor Jay) and found that this was the only
        thing that could hold her. Since Doctor Erin was stuck to Pastor
        Nancy, she couldn't escape either.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        There was another big rip and those two guys fell on the floor with
        Captain Curt. They reached down to press the buttons on their shoes
        again, but Sir Jay stopped them.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hold it! Who are you guys?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        One of them took out some kind of computer panel and pressed some
        buttons on it. "I am Wayfarer Curt."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "And I am Wayfarer Steve," said the other one. He turned to
        Wayfarer Curt. "What kind of names are those?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "This story must have the same author as ours," explained Wayfarer
        Curt. He pressed more buttons on his computer panel. "Yep."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What?" asked Captain Curt.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "We have to be going now," said Wayfarer Steve. They pressed the
        buttons on their shoes and rocketed back up to where they had come
        from. (Their story?)
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay then," said Sir Jay, "what should we do now?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "We could start by taking off my blindfold."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh yeah." Sir Jay walked over to Captain Curt and took off the
        blindfold. Then he told the black ninjas that he didn't need them
        anymore. They jumped down and disappeared in a puff of smoke when
        they hit the ground. Sergeant Jess and Miss Molly came in. They
        discussed what they should do with the villains and decided to keep
        them in the pit and feed them Convo food. They were going to go to
        a far off planet's moon and beam the pit with them in it down to
        the surface. Captain Curt pressed a button and told the guy at the
        controls to go into really fast speed to that planet.

        "How's it going to work again?" asked Miss Molly.

        "When the pit is beamed down, the rock from the moon will fill up
         the empty space that otherwise would've been left there," explained
         Sir Jay. Captain Curt, who had been looking out the window, noticed
         a sign that said "YOU ARE NOW ARRIVING AT: FAR OFF PLANET."

        "Um, Sir Jay," he said, "we're here."
      </p>

        "Not now, Captain Curt, I'm explaining this to Miss Molly." He sat
        there for a minute, not saying anything, thinking about what
        Captain Curt had just told him. "Oh CRAP!" He turned the steering
        wheel to the left, causing everyone to fall to the right (they
        rehearsed this scene better). When they reached Far Off Planet
        again, Sir Jay took the ship out of really fast speed.

        "Wait a minute," said Captain Curt, "didn't the teacup and saucer
        section separate back there?"

        They heard the familiar sound of the big rip and someone they
        hadn't seen before fell on the floor. "Hello there, I am..." he
        pressed some buttons on his computer panel, "...Wayfarer Jay. The
        other two that visited you before put your ship back together
        before you left." He pressed the button on his shoes and rocketed
        away.

        Captain Curt pressed a few buttons on a nearby computer display.
        "There. They're on the moon. Let's go home."
