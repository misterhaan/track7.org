        Of course we all know of the great pencil fighter Paul, but did
        you ever hear of the better pencil fighter Steve? Steve was
        brought down by the great Paul, but it was all a hoax. Steve's
        trainer Jay, who never got into a real fight until a few lines
        from now, was supposedly the best fighter in the world, but since
        he never tried a real fight, he was not sure. Paul was the only
        one that Jay wanted to fight with, pencil to pencil. The fight was
        scheduled to take place exactly one line from now. Jay spent all
        his time running in circles around himself, while Paul was going
        around slashing trees with his pencil. It was time for the fight.
        The two were sent to their corners and each one was given an
        eraser to erase all the marks from when they were written upon.
        After the first round was over, both fighters seemed beat. Jay
        broke his pencil three times on Paul's .05 lead, but Paul's pencil
        never even broke. The second round was even more exciting. Paul
        was madly slashing at Jay. Jay was just letting Paul wear himself
        out and when he could no longer defend himself, Jay decapitated
        him. He won the fight and got the Golden Pencil Sharpener. Jay
        took Paul's pencil and discovered that it was a PENcil, Pentech's
        new pen that looked like a pencil. Jay took it and became the new
        champion of the world, after conquering Russia and the United
        Nations.
