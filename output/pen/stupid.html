        The law of the wilderness is usually agreed to be "survival of the
        fittest."  Man was once part of such wilderness, but human
        civilization has done away with this law for itself through such
        creations as doctors, vaccines, hospitals, welfare, and those
        obvious warnings that we find on everyday products.  Not only do we
        attempt to protect to sick and the poor, but also the mentally
        unfit.  Formerly these people would run around clueless until one
        of their own actions disallows them to live.  Of course most people
        would have known better, but stupid people really can't help
        themselves in such situations.  In protest of this law of nature,
        warnings against idiotic misuse of products were introduced. 
        Lawyers with silly civil suits against manufacturers and marketers
        helped to encourage common sense warnings by getting large sums of
        money for unwarned stupid people.

        As professed by Agent K of the Men in Black, masses of people are
        panicky and dangerous.  This was his justification for keeping the
        rest of the world in ignorance.  This shows people in groups to be
        stupid because for the most part, the aliens posed no threat, yet
        the general public would fear them. The founders of the American
        Government also had little faith in the intellect of the general
        public, evidenced by their implementation of the Electoral College.
        By this creation they hoped to have smart people make the important
        decision of who to elect into presidency.  The actual wording used
        by these founders was "common man," meaning the average citizen--by
        himself--is stupid.  So the conclusion is easily reached that a
        group of people is always stupid, and in most cases so is a given
        individual.  Of course there are the few exceptions, who tend to
        write theories to explain everyone else because they like to
        understand such phenomena.

        Two men successfully brought a case against a lawnmower company
        after they lifted the mower in an attempt to trim their hedges. 
        These men dropped the mower on their feet, obviously causing them
        both bodily harm.  The blame was transferred to the marketer for
        lack of a "do not trim hedges with this machine" warning.  Any
        person with any common sense would know better than to lift a heavy
        spinning blade over their feet.  The fact that warnings against
        this and using a hair-dryer in the shower exist show that a
        relatively high number of people completely lack common sense, and
        lawyers are willing to fight for them.

        Two more facts supporting the stupidity of the common man is the
        popularity of America OnLine as well as Macintosh computers.  Both
        of these are set up for stupid people--making simple tasks
        painfully easy while sacrificing the more complicated tasks. 
        Stupid people like things such as these because they allow them to
        do the simple tasks and they would not even dream of being able to
        do the more complicated tasks anyway.  Thus they are perfectly
        content with complete lack of knowledge as to the existence of such
        tasks.

        Simply stated, people are stupid.  If you find yourself confused or
        defensive after reading this, you are most likely one of these
        people.
