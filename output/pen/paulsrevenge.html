        It had been almost a year since The J first tested his invincibility
        formula. The Paul was determined to get back at The J for all the
        things he wouldn't let the Paul do to him. He got the Ooo Ooy on his
        side, without The J knowing about it. The Ooo Ooy lived with The J
        since the Steve met him when he died, so he knew how to make The J's
        formula, and anyone who knows how to make the formula can easily
        figure out how to make the exact opposite. It appears to be exactly
        the same, but instead of becoming invincible, you'd die immediately.

      <p class="story">
        The Paul and the Ooo Ooy had just finished their batch of Death
        Drink. They decided that the Ooo Ooy should switch it with the one
        in The J's refrigerator, since it was also the Ooo Ooy's
        refrigerator.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        The next day, The J got up and checked his calendar. "I've got one
        week until my formula wears off the Jessi and I. We'll have to have
        another dose tomorrow so the effects won't start to slow down," he
        thought out loud. He went downstairs to his pencil-throwing
        range/chemistry lab to practice pencil-throwing.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        After the first pencil hit the dart board that The J used for a
        target, the Ooo Ooy woke up. He decided that now would be a good
        time to switch the formulas since The J would be downstairs
        practicing for about a half-hour.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The J got bored of practicing pencil-throwing after fifteen minutes
        and went back to his room to work on his most current game world for
        ZZT. So the Ooo Ooy was wrong. Big deal. At least he got the
        formulas switched. And I'm sure you've never been wrong before, have
        you. Oh, I 'm sorry. Back to the story. The Ooo Ooy called the Paul.
        In about 5 minutes, 34.56 seconds, the Paul came and the Ooo Ooy
        snuck him inside to talk to him.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Did you switch the formulas?" asked the Paul.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Of course I did," said the Ooo Ooy, "Where's the Steve anyway?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh, I knocked him off the paper."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What'd you do that for?!?! There's nothing for our author to write
        about without the Steve! None of the rest of us are going to be
        doing anything until tomorrow when The J and the Jessi drink the
        formula!" the Ooo Ooy was not happy."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay, Okay, I'll go get him, but you have to come too, just in case
        I can 't reach him."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Fine with me," agreed the Ooo Ooy. They set off for the edge of the
        paper.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "We're finally here," said the Paul as he sat down with his feet
        hanging off the edge.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Can you see him anywhere?" asked the Ooo Ooy.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The Paul looked over the edge. "Yeah. He fell into some story where
        this guy hunts other people, but he'll be fine since he's a ghost."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Not in another story," said the Ooo Ooy. They heard gunshots from
        the story below. The Steve had been shot! "We'd better get him
        before he dies. In that story there aren't any ghosts!"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay," said the Paul, "hold my ankles and I'll get him." The Paul
        reached as far as he could, and got one of the Steve's ankles. "Pull
        me up!"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        They got the Steve back into the right story. They knew that it
        would take a while for him to become a ghost instead of a dead body,
        so they decided to wait. The Paul walked around the Steve, because
        he 'd never seen a dead body before, and fell off the edge. The Ooo
        Ooy tried to save him, but he fell off too.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        In the other story, the Paul and the Ooo Ooy hid behind a rock,
        because they thought that whoever had shot the Steve would be
        coming. They were on the shore of the ocean, and it was beginning to
        turn almost totally black. They heard someone coming and sat as
        still as they possibly could.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I see blood, but there's no body, Ivan," said a male voice with a
        Russian accent, "What do you think could have happened to it?" There
        was silence for a while, and then the man's voice said, "Oh yeah,
        you can 't talk. Let's go home, Ivan."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        After they were sure that the men had left, the Paul said, "Too bad
        It 's night time here."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Yeah, it was just about noon in our story."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Let's just wait and see if something interesting happens, since we
        can 't get out of here. I don't have anything to worry about, since
        you can 't kill a Paul."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "You can't kill a demon either, but it's probably different in this
        story. Different stories have different rules."
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        Back to this story, the Steve became a ghost again. At first he
        wondered why it wasn't dark yet, but then he realized that he was
        back in the right story. He looked around, so he couldn't find
        whoever it was that rescued him. After a while, he looked over the
        edge. It was hard to tell, but he thought he saw the Ooo Ooy and
        someone else in the story below. He started back towards The J's
        house.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "What is that?" asked the Ooo Ooy.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What is what?" asked the Paul.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I thought I heard someone swimming in the ocean," said the Ooo Ooy,
        "We'd better get out of the way so we don't screw up this story any
        more than the Steve already did."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Yeah." They hid behind the rock again. Someone crawled onto the
        beach. "He probably fell off his own yacht," whispered the Paul.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Actually, he did," said the Ooo Ooy, "I read this story before."
        The man walked over to the spot where there was bloodstains and
        looked at them, even though no one could even see their hand in
        front of their face. After he was done looking, he left. All the Ooo
        Ooy and the Paul could do was wait and hope the Steve would find
        them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        "Well we're here," said The J, "where are they?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Look over the edge," replied the Steve.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "They're in that story down there," said the Jessi, "And if that's
        the story I think it is, they're in trouble."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Yeah, I was there and got shot already. Hold my ankles, I'll get
        them." The J grabbed one and the Jessi grabbed the other. They
        lowered him off the edge into the other story. He got the Ooo Ooy
        and the Paul each by a wrist. "Pull me up!" he yelled. By the time
        they were all back in the right story, it was time to go to bed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        The next morning, The J got up and checked his calendar, as usual.
        Today was the day he and the Jessi would have another dose of his
        formula. He went downstairs to practice his pencil-throwing. His
        first three shots missed, so he had to sharpen his pencil each time
        in between. "This is going to be one of those days," he thought out
        loud. Too bad he didn't know how right he was.
