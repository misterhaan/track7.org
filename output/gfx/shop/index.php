        support track7 by purchasing original designs through cafepress.com.&nbsp;
        each available design is on a separate page at cafepress, and there does
        not seem to be any way to link them together except through this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        profits from sales (if any) will go toward the cost of keeping
        track7.org available.&nbsp; if you would like to see more designs from
        made available or would like to see more options for a certain design,
        <a href="/user/sendmessage.php?to=misterhaan">contact me</a>.

          <p>
            this (obviously) is the track7 logo.&nbsp; i only have it available
            in the default color blue, but i can certainly add other colors if
            anybody wants them.&nbsp; i sketched this myself in pen on light
            green paper, then scanned it and changed the colors around.
          </p>

          <p>
            also part of track7 branding, the born lost and hopeless (blah) punk
            is available as the entire original sketch (not just the guy’s head).

          <p>
            this one is simply supposed to be funny.&nbsp; i thought of this a
            while ago (though in the form “always plan ahea” all on one line),
            and finally got around to actually making it.

          <p>
            this design is for everyone who works with information in some way
            or another.&nbsp; it’s meant to make you feel like a superhero of
            some kind as you spend your day getting paid to do . . . well,
            <em>information</em>.
