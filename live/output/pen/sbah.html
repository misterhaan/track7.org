        yeah so i thought i was all clever and smooth--if she didn't feel about
        me the way i was quite sure i felt about her, i could just pretend all i
        wanted was to see the movie (i really did want to see it, after all) and
        of course it's terribly pathetic to go see a movie as a onesome.&nbsp;
        the way she and i had been talking up until that point had me mostly
        convinced that she did return my feelings, and so i fully intended to
        make some form of a move toward a higher form of "us" with her.&nbsp; i
        was well aware of the fact that i was only but recently out of a
        relationship, but somehow i knew almost certainly that the feelings i
        have for this girl were true--that i was not in fact merely attempting to
        cling to the next closest thing to a girlfriend i could find.

        and so we went to the theatre together and just as i had expected, from
        the moment we got into the car together i was having an absolutely
        wonderful time.&nbsp; we walked together into the theatre (after i had
        made a bathroom break, of course) and as we sat down i just knew that i
        was not going to make it through an entire two or so hours sitting next
        to a girl to whom i am attracted in a wide assortment of fashions without
        kissing her.&nbsp; the whole time up until the movie began certainly was
        nowhere near awkward--we never did have a problem finding enough to talk
        about.&nbsp; so the movie started and there i sat next to her, watching
        her almost as much as the movie--recalling how i'd found her incredibly
        beautiful since the first day i saw her at school.&nbsp; my gaze found
        its way to her lips and all i could think of is how wonderful it would
        feel to have them pressed against mine, though i soon realized that to
        have her find me looking at her in the darkness of the theatre was not
        exactly something i wanted to happen that evening.&nbsp; against the
        wishes of my heart as well as much of my mind and body, i attempted to
        shift my focus as well as my gaze toward the screen, which was much less
        difficult with my gaze than it was with my thoughts.

        after watching a respectable portion of the movie, a thought that i
        should kiss her right then formed in my mind, and so i turned toward
        her.&nbsp; it seemed to me that whatever had affected me had also its
        influence on her because she too had turned toward me and her face read
        in such a way to assure me that this was most certainly the time we were
        meant to kiss . . .
