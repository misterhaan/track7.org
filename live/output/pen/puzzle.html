        the boy's father looked upon him and smiled.&nbsp; this particular smile
        the boy had seen a few times before, such as the first time he read 'go
        dog go,' when he learned to ride a bike, and the first time he brought
        home an a from school--clearly he had done something to impress his
        father, though for all the power of his young mind he simply could not
        recall having done any such thing for quite some time.

      <p class="story">
        "i want you to see something."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        at this point the boy thought that he had possibly misinterpreted his
        father's smile--that it had in fact been an excitement sparked by the joy
        of giving his child something he was sure to enjoy.&nbsp; the two then
        left the room, the younger following somewhat impatiently behind the
        older.&nbsp; when they reached another room, the boy was quite amazed at
        what he saw on the table.&nbsp; it was clear then that his initial
        interpretation as well as the 'corrected' had been accurate--somehow he
        felt that he had put together what lay on the table, while at the same
        time his father was quite excited at the thought of being the one to show
        him.

      <p class="story">
        "do you know what this is?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        the boy's mouth lay agape in awe, but he managed to nod his head.&nbsp;
        the object on the table was the most amazing puzzle he had ever seen,
        fully assembled.&nbsp; it did not depict anything that could be
        described, yet the boy knew exactly what it was, and it was truly more
        beautiful than anything he had ever seen or even imagined.&nbsp; he
        stepped a little closer and noticed that there were a few pieces
        missing.&nbsp; with this observation he became much less impressed with
        what his father had given him, and though he knew that his father knew
        why the pieces were missing, he found himself quite unable to ask.&nbsp;
        seemingly on cue, the father quietly left the boy alone in the room with
        the puzzle.

      <p class="indent">
        with the passing years the boy slowly understood more and more what
        exactly the puzzle was.&nbsp; each one if its pieces individually were a
        gift from his father, and over the years up until his father actually had
        shown it to him, he had been slowly putting each piece in its place--all
        without any notion that there even might be a puzzle.
      </p>

      <p class="indent">
        the missing pieces began to nag patiently yet incessantly at the back of
        his consciousness, and after some time he thought that he should seek out
        something with which he might fill his holes.&nbsp; the years continued
        to pass as he found various puzzle pieces in everyday objects, and some
        were given to him by people he met.&nbsp; each of these pieces looked to
        him at first to be even more beautiful than his puzzle, but as soon as he
        tried to fit them in, they became the most revoltingly ugly things one
        could imagine, and he was forced to either toss them away or return them
        to whoever had given them.&nbsp; this same trial and error continued for
        many years, slowly increasing the boy's frustration.
      </p>

      <p class="indent">
        all of these failed attempts to complete the puzzle his own way had
        pulled the boy away from his father, and eventually his eyes were opened
        to this.&nbsp; for years he had been running around trying to complete
        his puzzle when he knew full well that his father was the only one who
        had ever given him pieces.&nbsp; at that point he promised his father
        that he would no longer try to find the missing pieces--he would have
        them when his father wanted him to.&nbsp; after that the boy became a
        man, and he once again grew closer to his father, but still the years
        passed without him seeing an addition to his puzzle.

      <p class="story">
        one day while the man was relaxing in his room, his father walked in
        wearing a smile very similar to the one the boy had seen before the
        puzzle was made known to him.&nbsp; he recalled that he had not seen a
        smile of this scale from his father since that time.&nbsp; his father
        walked over to him and handed him a number of puzzle pieces.&nbsp; the
        man looked up and smiled at his father with a boyish joy--the kind a
        father would receive after returning a favorite but lost toy to his young
        son.&nbsp; the man took the pieces to his puzzle and tried to fill the
        empty spaces.&nbsp; he was slightly disappointed to find that not even
        these pieces fit, but he noticed that their beauty remained when they
        were brought close to the puzzle.&nbsp; he looked up in confusion at his
        father, who simply smiled understandingly.

      <p class="story">
        "now, i want to introduce you to someone."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        the man gathered the new pieces and followed his father to the front
        door.&nbsp; the father stepped to the side and the man realized that it
        was up to him to open the door.&nbsp; so open the door he did, and on the
        other side stood a woman who appeared to be just as nervous as he
        was--and rightly so for the both of them--though they did not know how
        they knew, they were fully aware that this moment in their life was very
        important.&nbsp; the man slipped his puzzle pieces into his pocket, took
        the woman's arm, and walked away with her.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        over time the two got to know each other, fell in love, and continually
        grew closer.&nbsp; eventually the man cared so much for the woman that he
        wanted to share everything with her, so he brought her to his
        puzzle.&nbsp; she was quite amazed by it, but she didn't appear at all
        surprised.&nbsp; she noticed the missing pieces and her eyes lit up as
        she reached into her pocket.&nbsp; her eyes met the man's as a smile grew
        on her face and her hand emerged from her pocket with a collection of
        puzzle pieces, which she then placed in the empty spaces of the man's
        puzzle.&nbsp; the new pieces fit perfectly, but they possessed a
        different form of beauty.&nbsp; the man knew that this is what his father
        had intended for his puzzle, and he smiled as he reached into his pocket
        and showed the woman that he too had pieces that didn't belong in his
        puzzle.&nbsp; he already knew that she had the puzzle they belonged in
        before the smile on her face confirmed it.&nbsp; the man's father,
        watching from a location unseen to both of them, smiled at how his son
        and daughter had turned out.
