        For years many people have believed that electricity passing through
        certain metals or other substances causes emission of light. People
        all over the world use light bulbs so that they can see what they
        are doing. Research has shown which combinations of energies and
        substances produce results like that of these light bulbs, but none
        has shown that they actually do emit light. Light bulbs actually do
        not emit light; but instead, they suck dark.

        Admittedly, the name "light bulb" implies that the object is a
        source of light. This name is merely a result of misconceptions of
        light bulb manufacturers such as General Electric and Sylvania.
        Mello Yello implies that the product is both mellow and yellow, but
        even the company that markets it recants this, explaining that
        "there's nothing mellow about it." Light bulbs are the same way; the
        name implies something that actually has little or nothing to do
        with the product.

        Granted, some may argue that someone has proven that light is
        emitted when a lamp is turned on. This is a false statement, since
        nobody can even prove that light actually exists. For years
        confusion has existed over whether light should classify as a
        particle, a wave, or both. Dark, on the other hand, is a much
        simpler thing, which scientists have never stayed awake at night
        because they couldn't decide if it was a wave or a particle.

        Light is usually a loosely defined word. One definition is "an
        extreme lack of dark." The word "dark" is part of this definition;
        hence, dark must exist and also have a definition that is quite
        clear elsewhere in the dictionary containing that particular
        definition of light. Sucking dark, therefore, interprets more
        precisely than emitting light.

        According to Holly Stowe, the amount of dark increases with the
        distance from the "dark sucker," commonly called a light bulb. This
        shows that light bulbs have limited ranges. For instance, Jeremy,
        who is standing next to a speaker at the MxPx concert, is able to
        hear less silence than Rob, who is standing at the back of the
        crowd. That, along with the fact that most of the laws of the
        universe have patterns, shows that light bulbs must actually affect
        dark, not light, because less dark is near them, but not less light.

        Easily observable by putting an object between a light bulb and the
        point from which the observer is looking, more dark is on the side
        of the solid object that does not face the light bulb. To explain,
        when someone turns on a vacuum at a sandy beach, the vacuum sucks
        the sand into the its holding facility. If one were to place an
        object such as a shovel between the operating vacuum and some of the
        sand, the amount of sand will be greater on the side of the shovel
        opposite the vacuum. People commonly accept that vacuums suck, thus
        light bulbs must also suck because blocking the substance that either
        of these appliances is sucking causes the substance to remain where
        it was before the hindrance was in place.

        Light bulbs cease operation after a period of time, regardless of
        whether of not they were victims of misuse. In the event that a light
        bulb falls from a great height, it becomes inoperative the instant it
        hits the ground, but this is a from of misuse. The light-emittance
        theory provides no other explanations as to how a light bulb might
        refrain from operating properly. Light bulbs actually do this because
        they can not accommodate any more dark. This explains the black marks
        on a "burnt out" light bulb. It has not stored all of the dark
        properly, and some of it has darkened the exterior of the bulb. One
        who actually believes that light bulbs emit light cannot account for
        this phenomenon.

        Light bulbs suck dark. When people say, "This room is too dark," they
        are using a shortened and rearranged version of, "Too much dark is in
        this room." Everyone encounters light bulbs, which are actually dark
        suckers, every day. They are present in nearly everything an
        industrialized country does, but until now, nobody has understood
        their operation. Sadly, the misleading term "light bulb" will not be
        changed because, like changing to the metric system, it is so much
        easier to just leave it the way it is now.
