        Exactly thirty-three months had passed since Sir Jay had shared that
        kiss under the stars with the beautiful Princess Brittany.&nbsp; In the
        real world the setting had been slightly different, but everything
        of fundamental importance from the kiss under the stars was no different
        from the kiss in the real world.

        Jay looked back upon the time he had been so fortunate to share with her
        thus far.&nbsp; He saw how true a friend she had been to him, always
        caring and often times making sacrifices for his sake.&nbsp; He
        remembered that every time he really needed someone, she was there.&nbsp;
        He thought about all the fun they had together--how free she always made
        him feel and how he never feared that anything he said or did might
        cause her to think less of him.&nbsp; He remembered all the little
        things that she had done for him--small things that did not require a
        great deal of effort on her part yet still had a strong and lasting
        impact on his heart.

        He remembered how a little less than a year ago, they had both
        'surprised' one another with almost identical gifts.

        His mind then shifted from memories of the times they'd shared together
        toward his feelings for her.&nbsp; He loved her more than he could even
        understand.&nbsp; He greatly enjoyed spending time with her--it hardly
        mattered what exactly it was that they were doing.&nbsp; He practically
        lived to see her happy--she had such a beautiful smile that whenever he
        saw it he couldn't help but smile back.&nbsp; She was the one person
        with whom he could share everything; the one person with whom he wanted
        to share everything.&nbsp; He wanted to protect her and take care of her
        and hoped that he would get better at it as time went on.

        As he stood there alone thinking to himself he noticed that he was
        starting to get cold.&nbsp; Hopefully she would be out soon.&nbsp; He
        desperately hoped that he was waiting in the right place--he had put a
        lot of effort into getting this right today.&nbsp; Just then he saw her
        come out the door and he smiled to himself.&nbsp; She didn't see him
        right away, and was surprised when she recognized him standing there
        waiting for her.&nbsp; He offered to take her bag if she would listen
        while he read her a story he wrote, and they set off walking together . . .
