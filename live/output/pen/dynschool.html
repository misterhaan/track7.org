        On occasion in physics class, a concept is explained to such a
        point of thoroughness that it causes the minds of those who have
        understood from the beginning to wander. When such minds are
        stimulated into relative wanderings by silly videos with Alberts
        and Henries playing space billiards, they may attempt to explain
        some phenomena of the universe which they did not formerly
        understand. Such wanderings have produced the following theory:
        Neenah High School has a velocity with respect to the earth.

        As many students and possibly teachers have observed, the bells of
        Neenah High School ring at a later time each day. This discrepancy
        is not noticeable from day to day, but synchronizing a watch one
        day and then checking it against the bell a week later one will
        find a substantial difference measured to be 9 seconds. The special
        theory of relativity states that time appears to pass at a slower
        rate in a frame of reference possessing a velocity with respect to
        another frame of reference. Thus, from this theory and the fact
        that time appears to pass at a slower rate at school we conclude
        the theory that the school is in motion with respect to the earth.

        Because the school has a velocity with respect to the earth, it
        must travel around the earth. This is because the school cannot
        travel into or through the earth, nor can it lift from the earth.
        The ability of students to enter and leave the school at 80 minute
        intervals along with the school's travel around the earth means
        that its angular velocity with respect to the earth must be .012
        rpm so that the school is in the same position on the surface of
        the earth at each 80 minute interval.

        The dynamic school theory shows that the time kept by the school
        bell will continue to fall further behind all other time. The
        progress of this is easily recognized by the fact that a watch set
        to the bell and taken elsewhere (immediately after synchronization
        so that deviance is diminished by significant figures), the watch
        will display an earlier time than any clock in the place previously
        deemed "elsewhere." Because of this and the fact that some people
        who are allowed access to the timing system of the school bells are
        too lazy to continually reset their watches, the bells will be
        periodically reset to more closely match the watches of these
        people.
