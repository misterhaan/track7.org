        in the beginning, there were markers.<br />
        and these markers came to rest next to white boards on nearly every door,<br />
        and it was good.
      </p>
      <p>
        those marker owners who also had friends,<br />
        could have messages from when they were out.<br />
        and it, too, was good.
      </p>
      <p>
        but envy shone through those who had no friends,<br />
        and they swept the entire hall, removing each marker from its place of rest.<br />
        and it was not good.
      </p>
      <p>
        the victims of this first theft found it rather strange,<br />
        and many of them simply replaced their stolen marker with a new one.<br />
        and it was, once again, good.
      </p>
      <p>
        but the jealousy had not faded,<br />
        and these markers, though secured by string or climbing rope, lasted only a few days.<br />
        and it was quite not good.
      </p>
      <p>
        yet there remained those few brave souls who would not be without a marker,<br />
        and so they devised new devices, employing a hose clamp to secure the marker<br />
        and finally, it was good.
