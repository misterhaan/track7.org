        "Check this out, it's the perfect costume." &nbsp;Jay put a pumpkin
        over his head that was carved in a silly design (the pumpkin, not
        his head) and stuck the end of a small flashlight in his mouth.
        &nbsp;When he turned it on, his head glowed red and it looked funny
        to Allene, since she was laughing.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "If it's dark enough and you wear black you'll look like a floating
        pumpkin," she said, "but I still need a costume."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I thought you were going as Donald McRonald. &nbsp;I know--we could
        cover you with shaving foam and spray paint it so you'd look like
        Silly Putty!"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Would that work?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "No."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        They heard a big rip and someone fell on the ground. &nbsp;Jay and
        Allene ran over to him and helped him up. &nbsp;"What happened?"
        asked Allene.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh, hi," said the guy. &nbsp;He pulled a calculator-looking thing
        out of his pocket and punched a couple of buttons. &nbsp;"So you're
        the main characters in this story, huh?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What are you talking about?" asked Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "You two are characters in a story. &nbsp;My name is..." he punched
        buttons on his calculator-looking thing, "...Curt." &nbsp;I'm from a
        different story. &nbsp;I founded the Inter Story Alliance Against
        Evil Story Hoppers--ISAAESH."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Why are you here then, Mr. Isaaesh?" asked Allene.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That's Curt. &nbsp;And I'm here to warn of an evil story hopper
        named Jay."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Wait a minute," said Jay, "My name's Jay."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hmm," said Curt as he punched more buttons on the calculator
        looking thing, "Most authors won't let two characters with the same"
        names be in a story...Nope! &nbsp;He's called 'The J' here, just
        like he used to be at home."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "At home?" asked Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "He and I are originally from the same story, but he was staying in
        a different story for a while. &nbsp;He went crazy when there was a
        coconut shortage."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "You mean because he couldn't put it on his ice cream anymore?"
        asked Allene.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Oh nonononono. &nbsp;It's much different than that." &nbsp;He
        leaned towards Jay, "I'd say what it is, but I don't want to offend
        the woman."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "She's not a good one to be offending either," Jay told him, "she
        hits."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Allene punched him in the arm. &nbsp;"I do not."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Anyway," said Curt, "here's a picture of him. &nbsp;If you see him,
        press this red button." &nbsp;Curt handed Jay a picture and a black
        box with a red button on it. &nbsp;He reached down and pressed
        buttons on his shoes and little rocket things flew him up back into
        the story above where he then took out his scotch tape and repaired
        the hole.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Jay took the pumpkin off his head and Allene took the flashlight out
        of his mouth. &nbsp;The author had just remembered that Jay had the
        flashlight in his mouth the whole time while they were talking to
        Curt. &nbsp;They were surprised he was able to talk so clearly.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Ahhhhhhh!" &nbsp;Some weird guy with a glowing green stick came
        running by and almost took Jay's head off with it. &nbsp;He turned
        around and headed for Jay and Allene again. &nbsp;He climbed up a
        tree faster than Jay had ever seen anyone do it before and yelled,
        "MUST FIND COCONUTS!"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I think that's the guy." &nbsp;Jay pressed the button.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I'm sorry, but we can't come to the button right now. &nbsp;Please
        leave your name and location at the beep and we'll get back to you
        as soon as we can."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Bummer," said Allene. &nbsp;Jay ripped a big branch off a nearby
        tree and in a pathetic vigilantilistic attempt, started swinging it
        at The J up in the tree.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hey!" said The J, "Be careful with that thing." &nbsp;Jay hit him
        in the ankle. &nbsp;The J jumped out of the tree and held the green
        glowing stick in front of him. &nbsp;It started to flicker and then
        it went out. &nbsp;He unscrewed something on the bottom and two
        D-size SuperVolt batteries slid out. &nbsp;"Argh!" he yelled.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What is that thing?" asked Allene.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "It's a magical glowing stick. &nbsp;I took it from Sir Jay in a
        weird story. &nbsp;That was after I stole a tractor that said Burtha
        on it from some freak named Paul in an extremely boring story."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Jay hit him in the back of the head with his big branch. &nbsp;The J
        fell over and Jay tried the button again. &nbsp;They heard the
        familiar sound of the rip followed by Curt once again falling on the
        ground.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Ouch," he said, "I should really assign somebody else to answer the
        button." &nbsp;He noticed The J lying face-down on the ground.
        &nbsp;He walked over to him and started to get his Chinese finger
        cuffs when The J swung his leg around and tripped Curt. &nbsp;He got
        up and ran and dove through the story. &nbsp;Jay and Allene ran to
        the rip and looked down. &nbsp;They decided it wouldn't hurt too
        much if they jumped, so they did.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="story">
        When they landed in the other story, they couldn't see The J.
        &nbsp;A small box fell through the rip and landed in front of Jay.
        &nbsp;Allene picked it up and opened it. &nbsp;Something looking
        like a metal detector was inside. &nbsp;The words "Infra-Red
        Footprint Finder" were written on it. &nbsp;Allene turned it on and
        aimed it at the ground. &nbsp;A few footprints appeared on the
        ground in front of them. &nbsp;They followed these footprints up to
        the doorway of a strange house.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The door was locked, so Allene was trying to pick the lock.
        &nbsp;Jay was looking around and noticed that there was a mat in
        front of the door. &nbsp;He lifted it up and found a key.
        &nbsp;Allene was still trying to pick the lock and she hadn't
        noticed Jay finding the key.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Here, let me try it," suggested Jay. &nbsp;Allene handed him the
        pins she had been using. &nbsp;Jay pretended to use the pins while
        he actually put the key in the lock and unlocked it. &nbsp;"I think
        I got it."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "No way," said Allene. &nbsp;She walked over and turned the knob.
        &nbsp;The door opened and they went inside. &nbsp;Jay thought it
        looked like one of the mad scientists' laboratories from Looney
        Tunes. &nbsp;Allene turned on the footprint thing again and the
        followed the tracks to the doorway of a dark room. &nbsp;"I can't
        see in there," whispered Allene, whose eyes didn't adjust to the
        dark very quickly. &nbsp;Jay told her to keep quiet and that he
        could see. &nbsp;They quietly snuck into the room, no longer using
        the footprint thing because Jay could see The J. &nbsp;The J
        disappeared behind a metal cabinet. &nbsp;By now, Allene could see.
        &nbsp;The J jumped out from behind the cabinet with a sword.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "On guard!" he yelled. &nbsp;Allene found another sword behind the
        cabinet and tossed it to Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "It slices, it dices, and makes a wide variety of bad guy soups,"
        said Jay. &nbsp;He and The J started fighting and Allene looked
        around for another sword. &nbsp;Jay and The J were making so much
        noise clanging their swords that nobody heard the Curt come into the
        room. &nbsp;Jay was forcing The J backwards and caused him to fall
        against a large machine. &nbsp;It started to whir and the Curt
        looked worried. &nbsp;Jay and Allene watched as he punched buttons
        on his calculator looking thing and The J escaped. &nbsp;"What is
        that machine?" asked Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "It seems to have brought all characters from stories up to five
        away into this story," the Curt explained. &nbsp;He punched more
        buttons on his calculator looking thing and said, "Oh great."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What now," asked Allene.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "All of the other stories from my series are in that range except one."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "What does that mean?" asked Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "That means there's a lot of Curts and Pauls and Steves and Jays."
        &nbsp;Now our three heroes (zeros) needed to somehow get everyone
        home and try to keep Curt from meeting himself. &nbsp;After punching
        more buttons, he told them that this story now had some kind of
        barrier preventing anyone from leaving or coming in. &nbsp;Jay
        noticed a microphone labeled "Really loud speakers outside," so he
        turned it on.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Welcome, everyone, to this deserted story," Curt had also figured
        out that there were no native characters in the story.
        &nbsp;"Everyone is asked to find their fellow characters and stay
        with them for now."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The J had been listening silently from just outside the doorway, so
        he knew what was going on. &nbsp;He left the building. &nbsp;While
        he was wandering around, he noticed power lines. &nbsp;He thought
        that maybe if he cut them, the power to the machine would be cut and
        he could escape. &nbsp;When the lines were cut with the sword he
        still had, the power was cut to somewhere else and the machine's
        power was increased. &nbsp;It was now strong enough to pull in more
        characters. Paul, Steve, and Jay were looking at The J.
        &nbsp;Especially Jay though, since he was to become "The J" in the
        next story for no particular reason.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Ah!" &nbsp;The J's head went down and his hand went to his
        forehead. &nbsp;He snapped back up and yelled, "COCONUTS!" &nbsp;He
        started to run, but was stopped by the words of Paul.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Hold on a minute there pal, what do you think you're doing bringing
        us here? &nbsp;And who are you anyway?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I am The J," said The J, "and I didn't bring you here on purpose."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "There he is!" shouted another Paul who was pointing at The J from
        far away. &nbsp;Allene was with him. &nbsp;"That's the guy who
        ripped off my tractor!" &nbsp;He noticed the other Paul and stood
        there, staring. &nbsp;The other Paul was doing the same thing.
        &nbsp;Allene took the magical glowing stick out of her pocket (she
        had found it when first tracking The J to the house), and put two
        D-size Energizer batteries in it. &nbsp;She switched it on as she
        ran over to The J. &nbsp;She cut his sword into small pieces and
        shut off the magical glowing stick before returning it to her
        pocket.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        By then Steve and Jay had realized that The J was a bad guy, so they
        pulled out their pencil-fighting pencils. &nbsp;The J dug around in
        his pockets and finally found three sharpened pencils. &nbsp;He had
        all the knowledge and experience of Jay who was better than Paul and
        even Steve, plus a bit more. &nbsp;He threw one of them at Paul, but
        Steve was able to block it. &nbsp;Then Paul realized what was going
        on, so he took out his pencil-fighting pencil. &nbsp;The other Paul
        came over and picked up the pencil that Steve had blocked.
        &nbsp;"Four against one," Steve pointed out. &nbsp;The J threw
        another pencil at one of the Pauls and hit him in the hand.
        &nbsp;Steve, Jay, and the uninjured Paul slowly stepped towards The
        J. &nbsp;The J held his pencil ready to fight them off. &nbsp;He was
        not successful, and was stabbed many times even after he was dead.
        &nbsp;Steve, Jay, and Paul threw their pencils as far as they could
        because now they were all icky.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Allene took the injured Paul with her and told the other three to
        stay there. &nbsp;She brought the injured Paul back to the house
        where Jay and the Curt were. &nbsp;When they got to the room with
        the machine that was whirring, Allene noticed the machine that goes
        "ping." &nbsp;She was surprised to see such an expensive piece of
        equipment. &nbsp;Jay had the whirring machine opened up, and he was
        inside it looking at the circuits. &nbsp;The Curt was explaining
        what exactly was bad about having all these characters in one place.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Allene figured out how to get the machine that goes "ping" to go
        "ping" and Paul's hand was healed. &nbsp;"Hey cool," said the Curt,
        "I want one of those."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Allene," said Jay from inside the whirring machine, "I've decided
        to go with Curt and join the Inter Story Alliance Against Evil Story
        Hoppers."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I want to too," said Allene, "but only if I can keep the magical
        glowing stick."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "We should return-"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I think I can probably figure out how to make more of those if
        you'll let me take it apart before we return it to Sir Jay," said
        Jay.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Okay Allene," said the Curt, "you're in." &nbsp;He shook her hand.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I've got it!" Jay's voice came once again from inside the whirring
        machine , "If we unplug it, everyone will go back to where they were"
        before it was turned on BUT, it will blow up." &nbsp;He looked
        across the room at the magical glowing stick. &nbsp;"I'll need
        that." &nbsp;The Curt tossed it to him and Jay told them to get out
        of there. &nbsp;Paul and Curt wheeled the machine that goes "ping"
        with them. &nbsp;Jay used the magical glowing stick to get through
        the walls and follow the power cable out of the building. &nbsp;He
        kept going for a while and then cut the cable. &nbsp;The explosion
        was bigger than he'd expected, so it knocked him and the other two
        down. &nbsp;He wondered if the machine that goes "ping" got damaged.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        When Jay found the other two, he found out that the machine that
        goes "ping" was knocked over, so he helped pick it up. &nbsp;It
        wasn't damaged at all. &nbsp;Curt punched buttons on his calculator
        looking thing and told them that all the characters except them and
        The J were back in their home stories. &nbsp;The J was dead, so they
        left him there. &nbsp;The rest of them went to Curt's home story.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "This looks like a good place to live, don't you think so, Allene?"
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        Curt looked up from his calculator looking thing. "She's 'the Puddy'
        now, but don't ask why. &nbsp;Your name is either The J or the Jay,
        whichever you pick."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "I think I'll take the Jay," said the Jay, "I don't want to be
        confused with a crazy man."
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        "Like it hasn't happened before..." Allene reminded him. &nbsp;Curt
        got them calculator looking things, those nifty shoes with rockets,
        and rolls of scotch tape. &nbsp;Then he showed the Jay to the house
        where The J had lived in past stories of the series and the Puddy
        to the house the Jessi had lived in.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        The Jay was able to figure out how to make more magical glowing
        sticks (in a variety of six different colors). &nbsp;He also built a
        machine that prevented characters from entering other stories that
        they were in so nobody else would meet themselves.
