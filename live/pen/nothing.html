        People often complain that there is too much gray area.  They wish
        for things to be black or white because the in-between makes for
        confusion.  Although it will most likely create a new confusion,
        all gray areas can be eliminated by showing that gray itself does
        not exist.  Unfortunately, the black or white alternative must also
        be discarded because black and white can also be shown not to
        exist.  Therefore, those things with gray areas as well as those
        which are black or white are nothing, and since everything is
        either black or white or gray areas, everything is nothing.

        Color is defined as a certain frequency of light which the object
        of the before mentioned color reflects.  Black is the misconceived
        occurrence in which no light is reflected.  This, by the definition
        of color, is not a color since no light is reflected.  Not only is
        black not a color, but it also does not often exist.  The only
        place true black can be found is in the case of black holes.  Since
        black holes cannot be found on earth, there is no black on earth. 
        Those things on earth thought to be black are instead exceptionally
        dark things.  They are not black because they must reflect some
        amount of light, even if it may be very small, in order to be seen.

        White, in contrast, has been defined as the reflection of all
        light.  This means that the color of any white object is dependent
        upon the colors of other objects which have already reflected light
        toward that white object.  White, therefore, cannot be a color
        because it is determined by the other colors present.  Not only is
        white not a color, but it also does not exist.  The only objects
        which reflect all light are known as mirrors, and a person who will
        testify that any particular mirror is white or even any color
        cannot be found.

        After the removal of those things which are either black or white,
        readers of this document are likely to desire the deletion of the
        remaining gray areas.  Gray can be anywhere between black and
        white.  Defined with two nonexistent endpoints, gray is left with
        nothing to fall between and must therefore not exist.  A darker
        white or a lighter black may also define gray.  These explanations
        again are based upon the nonexistent black and white.  Gray does
        not exist, and therefore those things with gray areas must also not
        exist.

        Some things are either black or white, while all others are gray
        areas.  Neither black, white, nor gray exist, therefore since all
        things must be either black and white or gray areas, all things
        must not exist.  Thus the conclusion is made that no things exist,
        or in other words, everything is nothing.
