        of course it's generally accepted that an infinite number of monkeys at
        an infinite number of typewriters will in fact pound out the complete
        works of william shakespeare, but can this concept be extended to
        infinite dubyas attemtping to run infinite countries actually managing
        to get it right at least once?
      </p>
      <p>
        first of all, it is necessary to transition from infinite monkeys to
        infinite dubyas.&nbsp; this is not a big stretch, as
        <a href="http://www.bushorchimp.com/" title="i am well aware that chimps and monkeys are not the same thing">dubya clearly looks like a monkey</a>.&nbsp;
        his intelligence level also appears to be close to that of a monkey.&nbsp;
        the concept of having infinite dubyas is a little more difficult.&nbsp;
        besides the fact that there is a finite amount of matter in the universe
        and it is thus impossible to assemble that finite amount of matter into
        an infinite number of dubyas, it's also just plain scary to think of
        there being more than one dubya (actually, just the fact that there is
        one dubya is scary enough for many).&nbsp; this difficulty can be
        dismissed though by considering that it's also impossible to have
        infinite monkeys for the same reason that it's impossible to have
        infinite dubyas (and some people probably find it scary to think of a
        large number of monkeys as well), but the infinite monkey theorem is
        still accepted.

        secondly, typing out the complete works of william shakespeare needs to
        be replaced with properly running a country.&nbsp; it is assumed that
        monkeys hit keys on the typewriter at random, and based on that
        assumption it is possible to calculate the probability that one monkey
        will randomly hit keys in the correct sequence to type out the complete
        works of william shakespeare.&nbsp; if it is then assumed that a dubya
        will attempt to run a country by randomly making decisions, the
        probability of making enough correct decisions to be getting it right
        can be calculated, which is the same model (though a different
        probability) as randomly generating the complete works of william
        shakespeare.
      </p>
      <p>
        the problem comes from the assumption that monkeys will hit typewriter
        keys randomly and that dubyas will make decisions randomly.  in the real
        world it has been found that <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/12/national/main553500.shtml">monkeys
        tend to favor typing the letter S</a>, as well as attacking, urinating,
        and defecating on the keyboard.&nbsp; this is not exactly hitting
        typewriter keys randomly.&nbsp; similarly, dubya has shown that he tends
        to favor making poor decisions, as well as urinating and defecating on
        much of the country and even the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        in conclusion, even an infinite number of dubyas attempting to run an
        infinite number of countries will never manage to get it right by making
        bad decisions, just as an infinite number of monkeys at an infinite
        number of typewriters will never manage to generate the complete works
        of william shakespeare by mostly typing the letter S.
