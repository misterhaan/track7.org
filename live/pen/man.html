        "What did I do?" is a common phrase uttered from the lips of a man
        who committed a relationshipial no-no.&nbsp; Next comes the
        stereotypical flowered apology.&nbsp; Still the man knows not what
        wrong he has done because he is not of the sentimental gender.&nbsp;
        This is the way it has always been, and what it shall always be, by
        decree of the almighty stereotype defining the roles of men and
        women in relationships with each other.

        A reversal of these stereotypical relationship roles is presented in
        "The War Between Man and Woman" by H. L. Mencken.&nbsp; He begins by
        stating that women are superior to men and they use this superiority
        to trick men into marriage.&nbsp; They use male sentimentality to
        their fullest advantage.

        Women, taking care to protect themselves from any possible glimmer
        of emotion, create a false sense of romance to get their man caught
        up in.&nbsp; Eventually he becomes trapped with no hope of living a
        happy, woman-free life.&nbsp; Even at this point, the woman still
        must keep her feelings out of existence as to not sacrifice the
        operation.

        Women's work is that of espionage, and those men who fall victim to
        it remain clueless until it is much too late.&nbsp; Men are foolish
        creatures, easily won over by women's advantageous intelligence or
        sheer power of will.&nbsp; Through marriage, a man does stand to
        gain some things, such as a housekeeper, but he fails to see those
        hidden downsides such as the addition of in-laws.&nbsp; His only
        hope at this point is to hold on to beliefs that his situation will
        improve, while trying to convince his friends that he has a good
        thing.

        Not only do women deceive men, but men also do it to each other.
        &nbsp;This is because it would be too painful for them to admit how
        hurt they are because they feel it is somehow their fault.&nbsp;
        Mencken, through his humorous view of relationship roles, does in
        fact make a good number of valid points.

        While women may not always have malicious intentions toward men,
        those men still have no idea what goes on in the collective woman
        consciousness.&nbsp; The power women have over men also rings true
        in non-satirical life.&nbsp; Men are often willing to go to great
        lengths to win the love of the women of their dreams.&nbsp; Of
        course, they have very little understanding of how female minds
        operate, which can easily foil their so carefully laid out plans.

        Though men will never know for sure, most probably entertain the
        notion that women are creatures capable of experiencing love.&nbsp;
        This helps them to maintain a sense of hope.&nbsp; Women help to
        support this ideal by displaying themselves as the touchier/feelier
        of the species.&nbsp; After they take a man through marriage, this
        façade of compassion is discarded, which is an argument against
        women having a heart.&nbsp; The other explanation for this
        phenomenon is that the heart of the woman grows tired of the company
        of that particular man.&nbsp; Thus men continue to know
        nothing--women either have emotions but grow tired of men, or they
        are stonehearted beings who never care one tablespoon for the
        well-being of any man.

        The aspect of women that men are furthest from understanding or even
        wanting to acknowledge the existence of must be brought up as well.
        &nbsp;"That time of month" is man's worst fear.&nbsp; Commercials
        which belong in women's magazines appearing instead on television
        would cause a hear no evil, see no evil reaction in most men, had
        they enough hands to do so.&nbsp; Any mention of the subject induces
        a feeling of overpowering confusion mixed with apathy that brings
        men to their knees, begging someone to "say it ain't so."&nbsp; Men
        neither know nor want to know what goes on down there-they are
        perfectly fine knowing to stay away when it does happen.

        Men simply do not understand women.&nbsp; "Can't live with 'em,
        can't live without 'em" comes to mind in that men often enjoy the
        presence of women, but due to complete lack of understanding, they
        find great difficulty in maintaining relationships.&nbsp; They
        continually screw up without knowing which of their actions brought
        on scorn from their partner because their intellect simply does not
        equal that of a woman.&nbsp; After many millennia of living with
        women and seeking their love, all men have found about them is that
        they like flowers.
