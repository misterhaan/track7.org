        As evidenced by the two most recent Windows releases (Me and XP), the
        old ways of releasing by version number and then by year are no longer
        in use by software giant Microsoft.&nbsp; This may appear to be a
        standard ploy to get people excited about another boring software
        release, but a Microsoft programmer who has been refused stock options
        recently revealed the gaping necessity which caused the change in naming
        convention.&nbsp; This programmer wishes to remain anonymous since
        despite the inaccessibility of stock options, he still pulls a
        significant salary from the company.&nbsp; For convenience, he allows
        himself to be referenced as "Bill," but also expresses desire not to be
        confused with Mr. Gates, whom Bill assures us he is not.

        Apparently in the days of Windows 3.x, the version number was coded as a
        floating-point decimal, which worked fine except for the case of Windows
        3.11, which simply had too many decimal places to be practical.&nbsp;
        With Windows 95 came the release-by-year to replace the less informative
        release-by-version.&nbsp; Bill admits that nobody remembers when Windows
        3.0 was released anyway, because "frankly, we just don't care."

        The network division of Windows (NT), however, continued to release
        under version number because networks are always running really old
        releases of Windows anyway.&nbsp; It was not considered important to
        include a release year for Windows NT until a developer other than Bill,
        overly concerned over the upcoming Y2K incident, felt it necessary to
        name the next Windows release with a 4-digit year.&nbsp; The next
        release just happened to be part of the NT division, and was released as
        Windows 2000, which left no indication that it was in fact a network
        release.
      </p>
      <p>
        It just so happened that this release also gave rise to a problem even
        larger than the problem of consumer confusion caused by this being the
        first release of Windows NT not clearly labeled NT.&nbsp; Unlike Windows
        95 and Windows 98, Windows 2000 requires more space since it stores a
        4-digit year.&nbsp; The version number or the year (whichever is used)
        needs to be stored in practically every program that is to be run in a
        particular release of Windows, and there had not previously been enough
        room to store a 4-digit year.&nbsp; Of course Microsoft was not about to
        release a version of Windows that did not work correctly, so a
        workaround was added to correct this feature while sacrificing much of
        the speed improvements that otherwise would have been made with that
        release.

        The release of Windows Me is Microsoft's abandonment of release
        practices involving any sort of number, though Me does seem to imply
        2000 as it appears to stand for "millennium edition" when pronounced
        "emm ee" and not "me."&nbsp; Microsoft claims that most people have not
        updated their web browsers since Internet Explorer 3.0 and thus have no
        need to know when a particular copy of Windows was released.&nbsp; The
        presence of numbers reportedly make today's average computer user quite
        uncomfortable because numbers look like math.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next Windows release will be Windows XP, changed from an earlier
        proposed title of Windows 2004, which was supposed to give it a more
        high-tech and futuristic feel, at least until the next Windows
        release.&nbsp; Besides wanting it to "not look like math," Microsoft
        also claims that the new Pentium 4 processors appear to handle letters
        better than numbers.&nbsp; "We think they can't count," Bill tells
        us.&nbsp; The Pentium 4's alleged inability to count appears to be
        Microsoft's main reason for moving away from numbered releases, at least
        internally.&nbsp; Externally, they want to appear more appealing by
        putting together cool-sounding yet surprisingly meaningless
        acronyms.&nbsp; "Most people don't have any clue what acronyms such as
        RAM, DVD, and HTTP stand for anyway, so it seemed perfectly acceptable
        to use acronyms that don't actually stand for anything in the first
        place."

        It is also rumored that Bill Gates got the idea to label the next
        Windows release with 'XP' when he was in the local Wal-Mart a few years
        ago and noticed that all the cool Super Soakers said XP on them.&nbsp;
        If this is true, Super Soaker is likely to be bought out by Microsoft
        before 2002.
