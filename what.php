			<h1>what’s all this then?</h1>

			<p>
				trying to figure out what track7 is all about?  the short answer is it’s
				my personal website, and i am <a href="/user/misterhaan/">misterhaan</a>.
				as it’s a personal site, i put whatever i want on it.  you’re likely to
				come across various things i’m interested in or have created.
			</p>

			<h2>track7</h2>
			<p>
				track7 has been on the internet since 1996, though back then it was “the
				site of cool stuffs” since i hadn’t come up with a real name.  since
				most good names have at least two meanings, you can bet track7 has just
				that:  the album <em>fathom</em> by mortal has 7 seconds of silence for
				its 7th track, then the hidden track at the end starts with “welcome to
				track seven,” which for a time i had actually play when you first
				visited track7.  the other meaning is that at the time i chose the name
				i had noticed that on most albums i listened to, the seventh track was
				at least a very good song if not the best on the album.  i guess i
				wanted to be the best site on the internet, or at least a very good one :).
			</p>
			<p>
				track7 started out on free hosting and spent many years costing me
				nothing at all to keep up.  for a long time track7 was a subdomain of
				various free hosts, with a redirection service pointing track7.vze.com
				pointing to the latest one as i had to move due to free service ending
				or me wanting more features.  eventually i started to have money and so
				started paying for hosting and also bought the domain track7.org (at the
				time both track7.com and track7.net, the one i really wanted, were
				taken).  i’ve had track7.org for long enough now though that if i did
				get one of the others i’d just redirect it here.
			</p>
			<p>
				track7 is a large site with varied and somewhat unrelated contents while
				most of the internet is more focused sites.  parts of track7 would
				probably do better on their own, but since it’s a personal site it
				doesn’t matter how popular it gets.  if people find it and something is
				interesting or useful that’s great, but the point of the site is for me
				to practice web development and have a place to keep all my stuff.

			<h2>misterhaan</h2>
			<p>
				the name <em>misterhaan</em> starts with mister for a reason similar to
				why mr. t has the mr in front — so people have to call me mister.
				during high school i worked at a dairy queen and at first my nametag
				said “trainee” under my name, which i thought was a nice excuse for
				being a little slow and not knowing much.  once i did know things though
				(even after my nametag no longer said “trainee”) i noticed people
				sometimes didn’t believe me when i told them we weren’t allowed to put
				certain toppings in blizzards.  one slow day i got out the labeler and
				made a new label for my nametag which had “mr.” in front of my name.
				after that people believed whatever i told them.  so the first part of
				the name <em>misterhaan</em> is for credibility and respect.  the second
				part is a name i made up for a druid character in some old rpg i don’t
				play anymore.  i just liked how it looks with the double <em>a</em> and
				how it sounds (it’s like han solo from star wars).  i don’t like to use
				my real name on parts of the internet anyone can see since i’m not into
				the idea of some crazy person tracking me down, so you shouldn’t see
				much indication of who i am or where i live.  if you don’t already know
				that stuff, you can just know me as misterhaan, or shorten it to haan if
				you prefer.
			</p>
			<p>
				i have a degree in electrical engineering and work as a developer at a
				software company, so i’m what people typically think of when they
				picture a geek (though hopefully a little better looking).  i know both
				the hardware and software sides of a computer pretty well, which is why
				track7 uses mostly code i personally wrote and i have been building my
				own computers for longer than i’ve had a website.  you can download some
				of my software in <a href="/code/">the analag underground</a> section.
				you’ll also see i sometimes post in <a href="/bln/">my blog</a> about
				web and desktop development.  i also sometimes write up more formal
				<a href="/guides/">guides</a> (some sites call them tutorials) to help
				other people figure out how to do things that may have taken me a while
				to figure out.
			</p>
			<p>
				when i do something or go somewhere interesting, i sometimes take
				pictures and add my favorites to the <a href="/album/">photo album</a>.
				each photo has a description and / or story with it.  though i don’t
				find the motivation to do it much anymore, i used to write
				<a href="/pen/">short stories</a> and have also drawn a few
				<a href="/art/">things</a>.  i still have my lego collection from
				growing up, and i started putting the stuff i’ve built on my own into
				ldraw to generate instructions so you can build
				<a href="/lego/">my lego models</a> too.
			</p>
			<p>
				now that you know a little bit about me, why not sign in and tell me a
				little about yourself?
