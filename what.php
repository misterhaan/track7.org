        track7 has been on the internet since 1996, though back then it was “the
        site of cool stuffs” since i hadn’t come up with a real name back then.&nbsp;
        since most good names have at least two meanings, you can bet track7 has
        just that:&nbsp; the album <em>fathom</em> by mortal has 7 seconds of
        silence for its 7<sup>th</sup> track, then the hidden track at the end
        starts with “welcome to track seven,” which for a time i had actually
        playing when you first visited track7.&nbsp; the other meaning is that
        at the time i chose the name i had noticed that on most albums i
        listened to, the seventh track was at least a very good song if not the
        best on the album.&nbsp; i guess i wanted to be the best site on the
        internet, or at least a very good one :).
      </p>
      <p>
        track7 started out on free hosting and spent many years costing me
        nothing at all to keep up.&nbsp; for a long time track7 was a subdomain
        of various free hosts, with a redirection service pointing
        track7.vze.com pointing to the latest one as i had to move due to free
        service ending or wanting more features.&nbsp; eventually i started to
        have money and so started paying for hosting and also bought the domain
        track7.org (at the time both track7.com and track7.net, the one i really
        wanted, were taken).&nbsp; i’ve had track7.org for long enough now
        though that if i did get one of the others i’d just redirect it here.

        track7 is a large site with varied and somewhat unrelated contents while
        most of the internet is smaller, more focused sites.&nbsp; parts of
        track7 would probably do better on their own, but since it’s a personal
        site it doesn’t matter how popular it gets.&nbsp; if people find it and
        something is interesting or useful that’s great, but the point of the
        site is for me to practice web development and have a place to keep all
        my stuff.

        the name <em>misterhaan</em> starts with mister for a reason similar to
        why mr. t has the mr in front — so people have to call me mister.&nbsp;
        during high school i worked at a dairy queen and at first my nametag
        said “trainee” under my name, which i thought was a nice excuse for
        being a little slow and not knowing much.&nbsp; once i did know things
        though (even after my nametag no longer said “trainee”) i noticed people
        sometimes didn’t believe me when i told them we weren’t allowed to put
        certain toppings in blizzards.&nbsp; one slow day i got out the labeler
        and made a new label for my nametag which had “mr.” in front of my name.&nbsp;
        after that people believed whatever i told them.&nbsp; so the first part
        of the name <em>misterhaan</em> is for credibility and respect.&nbsp;
        the second part is a name i made up for a druid character in some old
        rpg i don’t play anymore.&nbsp; i just liked how it looks with the
        double <em>a</em> and how it sounds (it’s like han solo from star wars).&nbsp;
        i don’t like to use my real name on parts of the internet anyone can see
        since i’m not into the idea of some crazy person hunting me down, so you
        shouldn’t see much indication of who i am or where i live.&nbsp; if you
        don’t already know that stuff, you can just know me as misterhaan, or
        shorten it to haan if you prefer.

        i have a degree in electrical engineering and work as a developer at a
        software company, so i’m what people typically think of when they
        picture a geek (though better looking).&nbsp; i know both the hardware
        and software sides of a computer pretty well, which is why all of track7
        uses code i personally wrote and i have been building my own computers
        for as long as i’ve had a website.&nbsp; you can download some of my
        software in <a href="/analogu/">the analag underground</a> section.&nbsp;
        you’ll also see i sometimes post in <a href="/output/pen/bln/">my blog</a>
        (named bln as a bit of a math joke) about web and desktop development.&nbsp;
        i also sometimes write up more formal <a href="/geek/guides/">guides</a>
        (some sites call them tutorials) to help other people figure out how to
        do things that may have taken me a while to figure out.
      </p>

        when i do something or go somewhere interesting, i take pictures and add
        my favorites to the <a href="/output/gfx/album/">photo album</a>.&nbsp;
        each photo has a description and / or story with it.&nbsp; though i
        don’t find the motivation to do it much anymore, i used to write
        <a href="/output/pen/">short stories</a> and have also drawn a few
        <a href="/output/gfx/#comics">comics</a> and <a href="/output/gfx/sketch.php">sketches</a>.&nbsp;
        i also used to put together some of my favorite songs, design cover art,
        and even mixed audio for <a href="/output/compilations.php">compilation cds</a>.&nbsp;
        i still have my lego collection from growing up (and actually still get
        more every now and then), and i started putting the stuff i’ve built on
        my own into ldraw to generate instructions so you can build
        <a href="/output/lego/">my lego models</a> too.
      </p>
      <p>
        for physical activity i enjoy <a href="/geek/discgolf/">disc golf</a>,
        mountain biking, and soccer.&nbsp; disc golf is the only one that you’ll
        see on track7 currently.&nbsp; i’m trying to do more mountain biking or
        even road / trail biking so maybe something bike related will show up on
        the site eventually.&nbsp; i’m also a bit of a video gamer, mostly on
        wii or my computer.&nbsp; sometimes i’ll post something about a game in
        my blog, and even put up a couple <a href="/geek/#games">gaming pages</a>.

        now that you know a little bit about me, why not <a href="/user/register.php">register for an account</a>
        and tell me a little about yourself?
