    <h1>track7 has moved servers</h1>
    <p>
      track7 has moved to a new web server.&nbsp; since you're seeing this page,
      you're still looking to the old server.&nbsp; until your computer realizes
      that track7.org is now at 208.113.136.248 instead of 207.44.250.91, you
      can use the temporary subdomain <a href="http://track7.dreamhosters.com<?=$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']; ?>">track7.dreamhosters.com</a>.
