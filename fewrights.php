      <h1>few rights reserved</h1>

      <p>
        the contents of track7 are copyright <em>few</em> rights reserved
        instead of <em>all</em> rights reserved.  i don’t have much reason to
        impose limitations on how my work is used, so instead of reserving all
        rights i’m only reserving a few.  note that some of the contents of
        track7 (mainly icons) come from other sources so it’s not up to me how
        other people can use them.  most of what i’ve used that i didn’t create
        myself has a license that allows for my use, but some of it i couldn’t
        find license info.
      </p>

      <h2>linking / sharing</h2>
      <p>
        i put things on track7 because i want other people to have access to
        them.  if you find something interesting or useful enough that you want
        to share it, please do!  link to or share any page of track7 however you
        see fit.  i do not provide quick-share links you can just click to
        quickly share a page from track7 on facebook or twitter or whatever, but
        that’s because i expect that my visitors know how to copy from the
        address bar and paste into the social media site of their choice and
        that i don’t pretend to be aware of every single such site out there.
        to share and image or download from track7 please link to or share my
        page that contains the image or file download link where possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        linking to my pages and not directly to my files is especially important
        for images.  track7 doesn’t see a lot of traffic, which means it doesn’t
        cost me a lot to keep it running.  if one of my images gets linked to
        directly from a page that does see a lot of traffic (for example, a
        popular forum), that means track7 needs to serve that image every time
        that page on the other site gets visited.  enough of that (or one
        instance with a busy enough page) can cost me real money.  that’s not to
        say i don’t want my images to appear on other sites, just if a lot of
        people are going to see it then it may help me out if you first download
        my image and put it up on an image hosting site.
      </p>

      <h2>credit</h2>
      <p>
        when using something from track7, don’t make it look like it’s your own
        work.  sharing a link to a page on track7 makes it pretty clear it’s
        from track7, but linking directly to a download or posting an image do
        not.  if at all possible add a link to either the page where you found
        it or to the track7 home page, with a statement that it comes from
        track7.  if you used something you learned here to create something of
        your own then that’s something new and i’ll leave it up to you whether
        mentioning track7 makes sense.
      </p>

      <h2>i want to know</h2>
      <p>
        have you used something from track7?  i’d love to see what you’ve done
        with it!  this is by no means a requirement, but if you can share with
        me please do because i am definitely interested.  mostly it’s that i’m
        curious, but i’m also happy to link to what you’ve done if i like it and
        you want me to.  check <a href="/user/misterhaan/" title="view misterhaan’s profile">my profile</a>
        for ways to contact me.

      <h2>stuff i didn’t make</h2>
      <p>

        as mentioned earlier on this page, some of the content on track7 is
        restricted by copyright held by someone else.&nbsp; the “few rights
        reserved” idea may not apply to these:

          cover art for all your bass are belong to us, rants and raves, khaos
          theory, save the party, and the ska-skank redemption are based
          respectively on images from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Wing">zero wing</a>,
          an <a href="http://www.mcescher.com/">m.c. escher</a> sketch, a

          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/">the shawshank redemption</a>.&nbsp;
          the icon for the graphics section is practically the same as the rants
