# track7.org
this repository contains the source for my personal website [track7.org](https://www.track7.org/).  it’s on github to track history, maintain a todo list ([issues](https://github.com/misterhaan/track7.org/issues)), and to make it easy for anyone wanting to look up how i did something.  since it’s my personal website, i am not interested in code contributions from others.  bug reports or suggestions from the user perspective are welcome and can be submitted as issues here (or [via the track7 messaging system](http://www.track7.org/user/messages.php#!to=misterhaan)).
